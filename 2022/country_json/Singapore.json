They have a very challenging situation to deal with in Xinjiang because it is one of those situations where you are not sure whether which way to go. If you take it very stringently and tightly, that may result in a pushback. If you ease up too much, that may result in situation bursting forth elsewhere. And from an external point of view, if you take a view that you want to express moral approval or disapproval, then you have to try and make a calculation whether that will make a difference to your objective, and will that make things better or worse in China? \n\nIt is always delicate for a country to be publicly expressed disapproval of and to accept that and say yes, I will learn and do better. I think no country in the world does that. So the question is how you are able to continue to operate with them and yet at the same time, you have your views, they have their views, and without compromising your position, you maintain your dignity but you do the business, which is necessary. You have had to do that in many countries on many occasions; your diplomats understand this problem.\n\nhttps://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lee-Hsien-Loong-at-the-Aspen-Security-Forum\n\nSingapore Consul-General in Shanghai, \u8a31\u744b\u829d, \u65b0\u7586\u65e5\u5831, June 26, 2021:\n\n\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u9a7b\u4e0a\u6d77\u603b\u9886\u9986\u653f\u52a1\u9886\u4e8b\u8bb8\u73ae\u829d\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u8def\u8d70\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u770b\u5230\u653f\u5e9c\u82b1\u4e86\u5927\u529b\u6c14\u6765\u6539\u5584\u5f53\u5730\u4eba\u6c11\u751f\u6d3b\u3002\u66f4\u4e3a\u53ef\u8d35\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5404\u9879\u63aa\u65bd\u4e0d\u65ad\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c45\u6c11\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u505a\u5230\u201c\u4fee\u65e7\u5982\u65e7\u201d\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7586\u91cd\u89c6\u4fdd\u62a4\u5c11\u6570\u6c11\u65cf\u6587\u5316\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002\nhttp://wap.xjdaily.com/xjrb/20210629/177030.html\n\nSingapore Consul-General in Shanghai, \u8a31\u744b\u829d, The Economist, August 7, 2021:\n\n\u201cWe have seen the great effort by the government to improve the lives of local people,\u201d gushed the consul-general of Singapore, according to Xinjiang Daily, a state-run newspaper.\nhttps://amp.economist.com/china/2021/08/07/chinas-efforts-to-lift-xinjiangs-economy-may-smother-it?__twitter_impression=true",

There may be some projects with PRC funding, but these tend to be balanced by funding from other sources.\n\nPrivate think tanks, however, reportedly receive more PRC funding. These included the International Public Policy Private Limited and Longus Institute, which seem to be dormant at present. There is suspicion that the Kuok family of Kerry Logistics/Shangri-La Group provides some funds to the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA), IISS in Singapore, and Yale-NUS College. ",

The scholar was told to use \"China\" instead. The organizer telling the academic to do so is a PRC scholar based in at NTU.\n\nA possible explanation may be the fact that NTU has far closer ties with the PRC, with the flagship training it offers to mayors from the PRC. NUS has a similar program for provincial officials, but it is much smaller. There may be faculty who are more willing to convey their preferences to a university administration more sensitive to such issues even if there is no formal role for a CSSA.\n\nAcross universities, some faculty have reported PRC students possibly complaining or putting in negative evaluations for emphasis on Taiwan, although this is anecdotal. Possibly because the identities of complainants or evaluations cannot be clearly ascertained. Whether such actions are motivated by the CSSA is unclear, even though the CSSAs have close ties with the PRC embassy. (See attached image)",

This was the source of some controversy, as some had claim to be Singapore citizens. This was a time after independence when there was campaigning for ethnic Chinese residents of Singapore to be considered citizens. Their status was ambiguous from the colonial period on.
