Turkey has joined the recent joint statement of 43 countries at the UN which condemns human rights violations in the Uyghur region. Turkey had earlier remained silent and tried to maintain a separate stance in order to not anger its public opinion, its own Uyghur diaspora and Chinese government. Turkey also signed an agreement with China for extradition of Chinese nationals which targets Uyghur community members. Even though Turkish government denies any extradition of Uyghurs, media and civil society reports show that Turkey extradites Uyghurs to China via third countries. Turkey also remains not very vocal about Uyghur issue despite demands from its own public, opposition groups, international organisations and Turkey\u2019s Uyghur diaspora.",
