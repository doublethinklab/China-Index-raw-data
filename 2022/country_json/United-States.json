It's also conceivable to me that in densely populated Chinese emigre communities -- think Canal Street or Flushing or some of the L.A. suburbs -- there might be Buddhist or Taoist \"benevolent associations\" which would get UFWD support to take a public stance on an issue of PRC concern, or to promote a candidate for public office.   In China, the national Buddhist and Taoist associations have been pretty well co-opted by the CCP, much more thoroughly than even the \"Patriotic\" Catholic Church or the \"Three-Self\" Protestants.
