The perception in Vilnius was that the action was clearly premeditated in order to make the Ambassador a temporary de facto hostage before even being able to come back to her country. Less than three months later, China unilaterally downgraded its official relationship with Lithuania to the level of charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, and asked the staff of the Lithuanian embassy in Beijing to hand in their accreditation cards by mid-December. Concerned about the implications for their diplomatic immunity, all of the embassy\u2019s Lithuanian employees along with their family members left China on December 15 in what international media described as \u201cevacuation\u201d.",
