The latest report of the latest Reporters Without Borders Index puts Zambia at 109 out 180 countries studied. However, the report further states that Hakainde Hichilema\u2019s election as president in August 2021 has improved the situation for the media after some difficult years even though the legislative framework still needs improving and Zambia\u2019s economic problems continue to hold back journalistic independence. Freedom House\u2019s Global Freedom Status categorises Zambia as partly free. This, again was based on the restrictive nature of governance under the Patriotic Front."
