The Albanian Ministry of Economy launched 8 industrial parks: \n\u2022  Koplik: The Industrial Park in Koplik, Shkoder, approved on January 4, 2008. With an area of 61 hectares, for industrial production activities, trade, agri-processing etc.     \n\u2022  Shengjin: Industrial Park with an area of 3,2 hectares. \n\u2022  Elbasan: Industrial Park with an area of 254,7 hectares in the region of the former Metallurgic Plant. \n\u2022  Durres: Industrial Park in Spitalle, Durres, with an area of 850 hectares, state and privately owned area.   \n\u2022  Vlora: Industrial Park in Vlora.   \n\u2022  Shkoder: The Industrial Park includes the former industrial center with an area of 137 hectares. \n\u2022  Lezha: Industrial Park of Lezha, proposed by the municipality of Lezha and approved on 27 January 2009. \n\u2022  Tirana: Industrial Park of Tirana approved on 22 July 2009 in Laknas.   \n\u2022  And one free Zone \u201cVlora Free Zone\u201d approved by the government on 11 June 2009. \nBut due to some problems with land ownership, infrastructure issues, ineffective promotional campaign and lack of enforcement of contracts and inventive packages those announced zones were not successful. \nAccording to the new law No. 54/2015 that entered into force, the areas defined as \u201cindustrial parks\u201d or \u201c free zones\u201d were replaced by \u201cTechnological and Economic Development Area\u201d TEDA which is defined, again according to the law as a \u201cseparate territory, a designated area of land or buildings and other immovable properties, developed in  accordance  with  a  general  plan  and  provided  with  the  relevant  infrastructure  for  production,  industrial development, trade and provision of services, which is estimated part of the customs territory of the Republic of Albania, separate from this territory in terms of fiscal and customs regime and which is governed in accordance with the provisions of this law, other legal and sub-legal acts for its enforcement.\u201d See: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324242126_Albanian_Model_of_Free_Zones_Implementation_and_Implications , \nFollowing the new law in 2015,  Albania envisioned having only 3 TEDAs: in Vlore, Spitalle (Durres), and Koplik (Shkoder).
