Since the direct pressure usually causes backfire from the Taiwanese public opinion, more indirect methods are used in recent years. The mechanism of indirect pressure is complicated, and it needs to cultivate local confederates to cooperate with Chinese government. The local confederates would build up local collaborative networks to leverage the influence from China and to implement the political goals they  desire.\uff08Wu, 2017\uff1a689-690\uff09\n\nAmong the local collaborative networks, politicians can use the messages Chinese authority pressuring Taiwan to put pressure on the government again, meanwhile to gain personal benefits. For example, in the beginning of 2021, Taiwan and Guyana announced to set offices in each other's countries, and Guyana later retrieved the decision due to China's pressure. Kuomintang stressed a lot more on blaming the government being not pragmatic and incorrect on their foreign policies rather than criticizing China's pressure.\n\nAlso, during the recent pandemic, Taiwan is having challenges purchasing vaccinations due to China's pressure.
