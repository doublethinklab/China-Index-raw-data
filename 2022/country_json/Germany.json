About 500 schools offer something called \u201cChina AG\u201d (a China \u201cworking group\u201d within the school), or teach Chinese as a language of choice (not necessity), or have a partner agreement with a Chinese school. About 5,000 German school-age children are learning Chinese compared to about 38,000 in France. Compared to 98,000 learning Russian it is quite small. There is an organization in Berlin to promote the learning of Chinese in schools. Its curriculum head is a former CASS scholar from the PRC. However there are many parallel systems for teaching Chinese based on Chinese-language curricular, e.g. the Huade Schools, which are nationwide. These are mostly for children whose parents (or one parent) are Chinese, and for some non-Chinese children. They also offer summer camps where the ideology is quite strict.\n",
