                "note": "Over the past three decades of North Macedonia\u2019s independence there has only been one big organised visit of Macedonian journalists to China, which  happened in 1996. This has happened after in 1994 and 1995, two Chinese journalistic groups had visited North Macedonia\nThe visit of journalists from China and a subsequent visit of Macedonian journalists there had happened through a cooperation between the All-China Journalists Association and North Macedonia\u2019s biggest Journalists Association of Macedonia, ZNM. The two maintain cooperation and sporadic visits of delegations. The last one happened in 2017 when a Chinese delegation has visited ZNM (see the URL above).\nIt was generally hard to pinpoint whether smaller group or individual visits by Macedonian journalists to China paid by PRC have happened ever since 1996. Experts consulted told us that the Macedonian State News Agency, MIA, has a bilateral cooperation agreement with Xinhua and that as a result several MIA journalists have attended visits to China. This happened in the years before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The last trip of MIA journalists to China happened in 2019, and had been facilitated and paid for by the Chinese Embassy in North Macedonia. Since the pandemic hit, there have been no similar visits. \n",

                "note": "During our research, we found no instances of North Macedonian media outlets of any kind offering Chinese news content.\nHowever, when it comes to the wider context, a Skopje based analyst and expert on China told us that in the last decade, unlike the influence of Russia which has been seen as more of a disruptive force aimed at spreading false narratives and creating problems, the Chinese influence has been rather different, focused much more at creating a positive image of China, as a benevolent soft power in the region and the world, and a country of stunning achievements. In this respect, the Chinese narratives have been visible in the traditional media, trough content provided or inspired by Chinese outlets, as well as in the online media and trough social networks. \nThe expert argues that this is the case mainly due to the bad financial state North Macedonian media are in, which makes them more susceptible to copy-pasting content from abroad instead of dedicating their own effort to produce such stories, rather than pressure or other forms of influences on them. \nSince the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a study on disinformation in North Macedonia has identified three main Chinese narratives that have also penetrated North Macedonia\u2019s media space: denouncing the possibility that the virus originated from China, emphasizing the failure of Western countries in dealing with the health crisis and outlining the help that China has offered to other countries, including North Macedonia. \nHowever, in the vast majority of cases, reporting about these topics in the country has been balanced or somewhat balanced, offering Chinese views confronted with the Western ones.\n",

This party is represented by 2 MP\u2019s in North Macedonia\u2019s 120-members Parliament, but is believed to be growing in popularity. The party has proclaimed anti-NATO and anti-Western views, and since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has met the Russian ambassador in the country and repeatedly shared Russian stances on the invasion, portraying it as a special military action to \u2018de-nazify\u2019 Ukraine. \nOtherwise, Chinese Ambassadors have a semi-regular practice of meeting representatives of the biggest political parties in the country of at least once in one or two years. These meetings always pass in a cordial atmosphere, but no substantial cooperation has resulted. The press releases from such meeting follow a similar pattern where the economic cooperation and perspectives are usually emphasized, and near the end follows a remark that the political party in question has emphasized its pro-EU stances. The last such meeting took place in June 9 between Chinese Ambassador Zhang Zuo and the leadership of the main opposition conservative VMRO-DPMNE party\n",
