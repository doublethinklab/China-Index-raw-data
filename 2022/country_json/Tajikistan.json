Funding conflicts in the first phase of construction and possible political pressure from President Xi on the Export-Import Bank of China led to the bank providing Tajikistan directly with $331 million to finance the second phase of construction. When construction on the plant was completed in 2018, Tajikistan was left with a $331 million concessional loan to Eximbank and granted TBEA full mining licenses for two gold mines to cover the costs of construction. This will likely force Tajikistan into further economic reliance on China and disrupt the legitimacy of its own economic sovereignty. https://www.caspianpolicy.org/tajikistan-and-china-discuss-improving-bilateral-economic-relations/ \n\nChina appears to have the money and staying power to remain involved in Tajikistan and Central Asia as a whole for the long term. It is Tajikistan\u2019s main trading partner, its largest creditor, and a major investor in Tajikistan\u2019s energy sector (mainly oil and gas exploration) and mining sector (gold). Chinese companies have won tenders to build roads, tunnels, and other transportation links, as well as to work in the Tajik construction sector. China\u2019s largest investment in the country is Line D of the Central Asia\u2013China gas pipeline, which will connect China with Turkmenistan\u2019s gas fields through Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. https://carnegieendowment.org/2016/02/01/tajikistan-at-twenty-five-rahmon-consolidates-power-pub-62630 \nhttps://tj.sputniknews.ru/20200128/tajikistan-tonnelj-gazoprovod-turkmenistan-china-1030620577.html\n",
