Having worked in one of Chile\u2019s main newspapers I can ensure that sometimes, when a company, organization or government invites a journalist to an event, they share expenses with the media company, such as accommodation or airfares. Nevertheless, this happens not only with China but with every country that wishes have a spot on the news.
