In general, there is a pattern in Bulgarian foreign policy whereby international coalitions/other EU member states are joined in order to make a statement on a certain matter - but very often this tends to be for the sake of participation. And as in this case, there was no discussion among policy-making circles or on the government level in a public manner regarding the PRC's imposition of National Security Law in HK. I think it would not be correct to say that the Bulgarian authorities have a clear position on the matter even if they joined the statement.",
