In 2015, the UK joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and sought PRC investment in the manufacturing, nuclear energy and telecommunications sectors. By 2017, the UK received almost 60 percent of PRC foreign direct investment in the EU. Notably, in 2021 Tencent took a stake in Britain\u2019s neobank Monzo. However, more recently the UK government has taken legislative action to limit PRC investment in the UK technology sector, in particular targeting PRC state-backed investment.\n \nDespite this, Tencent recently made a number of investments and acquisitions in the UK, including in a nuclear fusion technology company, a start-up focussed on the genomic study of rare diseases, and an open banking start-up.  \n",

An EU report from 2011 found that groups such as 14K Triad, Sun Yee On, Red Sun, United Bamboo and Big Circle are active in Britain, with the greatest concentration of activity in London\u2019s Chinatown, but with operations across larger cities in the UK such as Glasgow, Birmingham, and Cardiff. In 2019, the Times reported that Chinese snakehead gangs were feeding the resurgence of Chinese organised crime in the UK, involved particularly in people smuggling and drug dealing. There have  been further reports of triad activity in 2013, such as a brawl between members of two factions of Chinese triads fought in the streets of Manchester\u2019s Chinatown. An academic article from 2016 examines the UK\u2019s policing of Chinese organised crime in the UK based on research from 2010 and 2014-2015. This research argues that the threat from locally based Chinese triads in the UK closely linked to Hong Kong has diminished and instead mainland Chinese networks which operate across the UK with links to mainland China have become predominant in the UK triad society. Secondly, the research argues that these triads in the UK are also changing the type of criminal activity they are involved in, such as production and export of firearms and new drugs to the UK, to smuggling counterfeit goods. The latest reporting on Chinese triad activity in the UK was from 2019, when the bodies of 30 people were found in the lorry crossing into the UK. ",
