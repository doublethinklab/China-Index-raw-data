According to Kaspersky, evidence indicated that the cyber-espionage campaign was active starting from 2007 before being detected in 2013. Armenia made the top ten most infected list with ten cases of infection with the virus. Russia was the most attacked country with 37 cases of Red October infections. It has never been revealed who launched Red October. Security experts were able to detect traces of Russian in the coding but those could have been intentionally planted in an attempt to divert attention. Moreover, Russia was the main target of this attack. There are plausible traces indicating China\u2019s involvement. Parts of the used technology could be linked to programs used against Tibetan activists and are assumed to be used by China's special services. ",
