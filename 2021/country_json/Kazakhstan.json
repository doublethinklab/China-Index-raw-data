Serik Azhibai is the latest object of that harassment. On August 3, Azhibai was arrested by police after holding a one-man picket outside China\u2019s consulate in Almaty. The purpose of the demonstration was to demand the expulsion of Beijing\u2019s ambassador, Zhang Xiao, who has provoked ill-will among citizens and officials alike with remarks perceived as disrespecting Kazakhs and their nation\u2019s sovereignty. https://eurasianet.org/kazakhstan-squeezes-china-critics-as-xinjiang-anxieties-spread",
