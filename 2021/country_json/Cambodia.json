Petty traders from China sell cheap goods on Cambodia\u2019s markets, while infrastructural development is largely undertaken by Chinese state-owned companies and financed by Chinese banks\n\u2022 \u2026Economically, Cambodia is now one of several countries around the world whose debt to China amounts to more than 25 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP), according to the latest report by Germany-based Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\nAlthough its current level of public debt owed to Beijing is lower than some other countries, Cambodia must be conscious not to fall into China\u2019s debt-trap diplomacy, whereby it uses debt alleviation as a geoeconomic tool to coerce insolvent borrowers into making concession of strategic facilities, such as a deep-water port and air hub in the cases of Sri Lanka and Zambia.\nDiplomatically, Cambodia\u2019s reputation on the world stage has suffered a number of setbacks in recent years. For instance, its bid to become a nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council in 2012 fell flat after concerns were raised about its troubling human rights record, which is often linked to China\u2019s backing of the current government in Phnom Penh\u2026 Cambodia\u2019s Disastrous Dependence on China: A History Lesson \u2013 The Diplomat \n\u2022 \u2026The Chinese have become managers of state enterprises that construct hydropower plants, roads, and bridges\u2014as well as private investors and managers in mining, agricultural land concessions, tourism land concessions, and garment manufacturing. At the same time, numbers of new Chinese immigrants have grown in the country. The economic interaction between the two countries, particularly the increasing bilateral trade, Chinese investment, and projects in Cambodia, is considered a factor increasing the number of new Chinese migrants. The position of the Chinese minority in the kingdom, which had been difficult in the 1970s and 1980s, has been seen to be taking a turn for the better. Currently, the Khmer-Chinese seem to have regained much of their previous cultural, economic, and political power and have become backers for new Chinese businesses\u2026. \n\u2022 \u2026.By channeling aid and investment into Cambodia via politically connected tycoons and in accordance with Hun Sen\u2019s development agenda, Chinese private and public investors have provided Hun Sen the resources to oil the patronage system\u2026 https://www.iias.asia/the-newsletter/article/old-new-chinese-business-phnom-penh",
