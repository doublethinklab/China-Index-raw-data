Objectively, we consider the previous indicator to answer this one, since video surveillance systems make up smart cities systems. Still, evidence was sought that focused on other elements of smart cities. Thus, we return to reference the examples of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Campinas and the state of Bahia that used Huawei's facial recognition cameras. Thus, partnerships for video surveillance systems are considered as a smart cities system. It is also noteworthy that representatives of the state of Bahia and the city of Campinas attended the Smart City Forum, held in the Chinese city of Shenzhen in 2019. As there are 3 large cities, we chose the answer \"Few, but significant\".\n",
