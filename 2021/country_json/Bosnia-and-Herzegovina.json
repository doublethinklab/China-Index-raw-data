The only critical infrastructure which may eventually fall under full control by a PRC-related entity is related to a lignite mine close to the city of Doboj. Namely, The Chinese Development Bank can take over full concession over this mine in case the current business group, owned by a Serbian businessman Vuk Hamovi\u0107, cannot make the loan payments.\n\nPRC-related entities have a number of contracts signed with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding upcoming infrastructure projects. There is a 297 million Euro worth contract signed in 2018 with the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding the building of a 40 kilometer stretch of highway between Banja Luka and Prijedor. The other major infrastructure project, the building of \u201cBlok 7\u201d of the Tuzla power plant, is in major danger of falling through due to the inability of the PRC-controlled entity to fulfill the obligations from the contract it signed with the government of the entity of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The reason for their inability to fulfill the stipulations from the contract stems from General Electric\u2019s pulling out of the project. ",

                "note": "Since the question asks regarding the potential ownership of critical infrastructure by PRC-related entities, I think the appropriate answer is \u201cNO\u201d as there is no evidence of existing direct ownership of critical infrastructure. While PRC-related entities are involved in numerous infrastructure projects, there is no evidence that they own any of those. Nonetheless, if the \u201coperate\u201d part of the question should include their participation in ongoing infrastructure projects as companies conducting the construction work, then the answer should be changed to \u201cYES\u201d since there is plentiful evidence of them being involved in major infrastructure projects. Moreover, the contract signed regarding the building of 40 kilometers of highway is based on the understanding that the PRC-related entity would operate it for a period of time once it is completed. However, my judgment here was that since the project has not been completed yet, it should be treated as an infrastructure project that is substantially controlled or operated by a PRC-related entity. In case I have misunderstood the wording of the indicator, I would be willing to change the influence measure if it is supposed to include unfinished and future projects (or projects where PRC-related entities are taking part in as contractors).",

The unilateral moves of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which are nothing but interference in China's internal affairs, are inadmissible, unacceptable and result in serious disruption of good and friendly relations with China - Milorad Dodik, member of the Presidency of BiH (22.6.2021 https://avaz.ba/vijesti/bih/661071/dodik-podrska-kini-sda-se-predstavlja-kao-zastitnica-muslimana)\n\n-\tIn a very short time, you have achieved impressive results in alleviating and eradicating poverty and thus made a great contribution to the fight against poverty globally. I would like to take this opportunity to thank your country for supporting us in the most difficult times. Your help has always been timely, concrete, without conditions, but above all sincere and fraternal. - Milorad Dodik, member of the Presidency of BiH (9.2.2021 https://www.bljesak.info/vijesti/politika/dodik-kinezima-o-buducnosti/338246)\n\n-\tAlthough we have been given opportunities to learn more about China through various media and technologies, I want to go there to feel that wealth, the wealth in every sense. It will be an exceptional experience for me, especially considering that I come from a smaller, different country. A visit to Beijing, Shanghai or any other city will give me the opportunity to witness a growth trend. China has succeeded in this in a very short period of time.
