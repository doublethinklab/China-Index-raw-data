The Uzbek president thanked China for providing timely support to Uzbekistan in fighting the pandemic.

The significant market liberalization and economic reforms implemented by the new president have made the country one of the five fastest growing in the world, giving a boost to bilateral ties as China\u2019s goals for regional development align with Uzbekistan\u2019s economic ambitions. It has also made the country increasingly investor-friendly and more welcoming of Chinese investment than some of its neighbors.\nIn 2020, Uzbekistan upped the number of visa-free days Chinese citizens could enjoy in the country from five to seven to facilitate travel and tourism in the country. The two countries have also deepened cultural exchange. Uzbekistan was the first country in the world to open a Confucius Institute, a Chinese language and cultural institution, and centers for the study of Uzbek language and culture have been set up in Chinese universities.-https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-uzbekistan-bilateral-trade-and-future-outlook/",

Chinese military education programs are especially attractive to officers from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, which have limited access to Russian military training\u2026\nAs Beijing seeks to increase the enrollment of foreign students, universities have begun to actively recruit Central Asian military officers for Chinese programs. Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan now have senior military officials who have been educated in Chinese universities\u2026\nThe university builds direct relations with leading military academies in Central Asia as well. The PLA NDU and the Armed Forces Academy of Uzbekistan are cooperating on educational exchanges. Some governments have carefully balanced enrollment among these three directions (Russia, China, and Western countries) to avoid tilting toward any one in particular. Chinese universities offer dozens of slots for students from Uzbekistan, but Tashkent only takes one-third of them. Students and staff of the Military-Technical Institute of the National Guard of Uzbekistan take Chinese-language classes to build proficiency in case they have an opportunity to study in China. https://www.ponarseurasia.org/chinas-expanding-military-education-diplomacy-in-central-asia/ \n",
