In addition, although there is no explicit evidence on activities developed by the UFWD, it is important to deepen research in this regard.","Finally, in the Military Domain there is no variation, which can be explained by the strong ties between Colombia and the United States, particularly in this field. However, in the research to cover the Indicators in the law enforcement Domain, doubts remain regarding the use of technology from China for the development of video surveillance activities by local and national governments, as well as the existence of an overseas PRC police base in the city of Bogota, according to a report published by Safeguard Defenders.
