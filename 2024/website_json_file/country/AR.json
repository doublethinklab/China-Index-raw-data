This trend has developed over several years, emerging amid a perceived lack of strategic direction in Argentina\u00b4s foreign policy. In this context, China has capitalized on institutional vulnerabilities by cultivating relationships with lower-ranking political figures and academics, thereby consolidating its influence.","The survey results suggest that as companies and democratic states traditionally engaged with Latin America reduced their presence, China responded by filling this vacuum through a multidimensional, high-intensity approach. This strategy has gradually influenced Argentina\u00b4s decision-making to the extent that expressing opposition to China is increasingly perceived as politically untenable.","Moreover, there has been a noticeable strengthening of ties between China and Argentina's subnational governments and municipalities. This dynamic appears to provide local entities with opportunities to finance public works, particularly in light of federal budgetary adjustments. Consequently, this may amplify China's ability to exert influence in local affairs.","In the first year of Javier Milei's administration, efforts to redefine relations with China have encountered substantial challenges due to China's presence in Argentina's economic, political, and social spheres. These challenges have necessitated a more pragmatic recalibration of President Milei's initial ambitions, aligning his administration's approach with the geopolitical and economic realities facing the country."],"description-1":"In 2023, Argentina had a GDP per capita of US$13,731 and a total population of 45.46 million people.","description-2":"Argentina established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1972.
