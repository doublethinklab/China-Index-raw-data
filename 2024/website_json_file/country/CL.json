Elite relations are not limited to political ideology or international positioning, and many parliamentary members or authorities have defended China, even when it comes to human rights issues. Since the economic relations are strong, notable businesspeople are often linked to the PRC and defend the system.","Chile has mildly increased its security debate regarding China, in areas such as technology and strategic economic endevours, with both supporters and detractors at a national level.
