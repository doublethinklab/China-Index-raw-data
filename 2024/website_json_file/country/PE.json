However, the economic aspect is most critical when it comes to China's influence in Peru.","In the last 15 years, China has positioned itself economically in Peru via the Free Trade Agreement between both countries. This has allowed China to be the owner of the main copper producing mine in the country, to build the future main port terminal in South America at Chancay, and to own companies in charge of the generation and distribution of electrical energy. All this is due to the positive foreign policy that Peru has towards the PRC.","Chinese migration to Peru has contributed in cultural, economic and social aspects, earning a reputation as among the most Chinese countries in Latin America, as mentioned by journalist Patricia Castro Obando.
