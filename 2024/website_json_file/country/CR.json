Some of the presentations at the national and subnational government level, as well as the political class, which benefits from travel, show the country's commitment to the People's Republic of China. Legislators, for example, look to China as a country with which they can continue to grow in economic terms.","Media appears to be a very important element. In the Media Domain, there are journalists who continue to benefit from training programs developed by China. Some media outlets use friendly language and reproduce information from PRC state media agencies.","The results support the widely held view that academia remains an important part of China and Chinese party-state entities. Scholarship programs, for example, that benefit students and professors are maintained.","In terms of technology, in 2023 there was a conflict between the two nations when the national government excluded China from its 5G service. However, there are several local governments that replicate China's surveillance system.","In terms of Economy, despite the fact that Costa Rica signed a Free Trade Agreement with China more than a decade ago, it is still a blurred mirror for the Central American country, i.e. it has not been successful.
