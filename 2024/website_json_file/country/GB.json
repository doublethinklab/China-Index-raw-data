More extensive evidence has been found in the PRC's deep ties of cooperation with the UK, especially in sensitive sectors with frontier technology. This makes sense within the context of the UK's large and renowned university sector, with world leading research across a range of sectors.","Foreign Policy has replaced Military as the lowest scoring category in 2023, but the difference is marginal. Despite the PRC's attempts to pressure the UK into adopting a softer stance on China, the UK maintains a robust opposition to various claims made by China in international and human rights disputes, with Hong Kong continuing to be a source of tension.","The PRC has attempted to build its political influence on multiple levels by signing agreements with various devolved governments and local authorities on economic cooperation, attempting to compromise or co-opt junior politicians, and hiring high-level veteran political aides or politicians to promote cooperation between the UK and the PRC.","The PRC does not appear to have devoted large amounts of resources to cultivating friendly political voices within the British Chinese community or have gained much influence through the community. This is contrary to what has been observed in other Anglophone countries with relatively larger British Chinese populations, such as Australia.

Shortly afterwards, Britain listed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a group supporting the independence of Xinjiang\/ East Turkestan from China, as a terrorist organisation. The London Policing College, a private UK company which provides police training internationally, led a project funded by UK aid money for a partnership with Hunan Policy academy and Shanghai Police College. A Privacy International repprt from 2019 details how Britain has used Project Hunter to export its intelligence-gathering methods.\n\nWhile there is evidence of cooperation between British and Chinese law enforcement authorities on combatting terrorism, there is no publicly available evidence of any formal cooperation agreements having been signed.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/china-uk-high-level-security-dialogue-official-statement\/china-uk-high-level-security-dialogue-communique","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-britain-security-idUSKCN1000PT\/","https:\/\/www.freedomfromtorture.org\/sites\/default\/files\/2022-07\/china%20report%2021%20lorez_0.pdf","https:\/\/www.islam21c.com\/politics\/british-government-facing-criticism-for-abetting-genocide-of-uyghur-muslims-by-exporting-techniques-and-training-to-chinese-communist-party\/"],"note":"","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 2 anonymous experts."},{"number":"91","score":"4","grading":"0","evidence":"The Chinese triads have a long history of criminal activity across the UK.

While this was reported in December 2023, the breaches have started as far back as 2015. In August 2023, it was reported that Russian and Chinese hackers have breached the Foreign Office's internal systems, which gave the access to the day-to-day business of the government department. In 2020 and 2021, the UK and its allies repeatedly condemend China for conducting malicious cyber activity. In 2022, the MI5 and the FBI held a joint press conference warning Western businesses of the cyber security threat posed by the CCP. There is, therefore, reason to rate this Indicator as 'More than a few'.\n\nGiven the attacks may have breached Sellafield's system and have breached the Foreign Office's system, the sensitive nature of the targets warrants a 'Significant' rating.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2023\/dec\/04\/sellafield-nuclear-site-hacked-groups-russia-china","https:\/\/inews.co.uk\/news\/russian-chinese-hackers-foreign-office-cyber-attack-secret-public-2541644","https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/10148825\/britain-denies-sellafield-nuclear-site-cyber-attack-report\/","https:\/\/www.ncsc.gov.uk\/news\/uk-condemns-chinese-cyber-attacks-against-businesses-governments","https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/uk-and-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-a-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking","https:\/\/lordslibrary.parliament.uk\/china-security-challenges-to-the-uk\/#heading-4"],"note":"","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 2 anonymous experts."},{"number":"96","score":"4","grading":"0","evidence":"The UK security minister, Tom Tugendhat, reported that China has closed its 'police service stations' at sites across Britain.

At least 28 councils were utilizing video surveillance technologies produced by Hikvision, the vendor for the Xinjiang police. Seven councils employed technology from Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. Ltd., the PRC's second-largest surveillance equipment company. This equipment is deployed in the UK for monitoring public spaces. Furthermore, a majority of law enforcement agencies across England and Wales use camera equipment that is either manufactured in China or contains significant Chinese components. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has instructed departments to cease the installation of China-linked surveillance cameras in sensitive buildings amid privacy concerns and products linked to human rights abuses in China. Currently, a bill is being considered in the UK Parliament to ban Chinese surveillance technology from government buildings and military bases.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/bigbrotherwatch.org.uk\/2022\/07\/mps-call-on-government-to-ban-chinese-cctv-in-the-uk\/","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/uk\/uks-house-commons-backs-blocking-chinese-cameras-govt-sites-2023-09-13\/","https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2022\/11\/25\/tech\/uk-chinese-surveillance-cameras-restrictions-intl-hnk\/index.html","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-britain-tech-china-idUSKBN2AI0QJ","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/feb\/15\/chinese-cameras-leave-british-police-vulnerable-to-spying-says-watchdog","https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/uk\/uk-remove-chinese-made-surveillance-equipment-sensitive-government-sites-2023-06-07\/"],"note":"","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 2 anonymous experts."}]},"exposure_rank":18,"pressure_rank":8,"alignment_rank":61}
