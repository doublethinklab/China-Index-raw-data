In 2023, the Federal Police launched an operation aimed at dismantling a criminal organization and investigate links with the Chinese mafia. The Chinese mafia is strongest in the central region of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, where most of the Chinese community in Brazil is also concentrated. However, we find no concrete evidence of this \"Chinese Mafia\" expressly linked with the Triads, even so some studies attest the presence of them in Latin America, including Brazil.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br\/geral\/noticia\/2017-03\/policia-civil-prende-14-integrantes-da-mafia-chinesa-em-sao-paulo","https:\/\/www.mpsp.mp.br\/w\/policia-federal-e-gaeco-deflagram-operacao-visando-a-desarticular-organizacao-criminosa-e-investigam-vinculo-com-mafia-chinesa-","https:\/\/dialogo-americas.com\/articles\/triads-snakeheads-and-flying-money-the-underworld-of-chinese-criminal-networks-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean\/"],"note":"","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},{"number":"92","score":"2","grading":"1","evidence":"Over the past few years, a number of subnational governments have hosted representatives from PRC companies or travel abroad to visit their headquarters in order to build a partnership agenda covering public safety issues.

Similar examples of bilateral and multilateral cooperation were found between the Public Security Secretariat of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, in partnership with the New York City Police (USA) and the Ministry of Justice and Public Security of Brazil with Interpol, for example. The Federal Police and Ministry of Public Security of China signed an act in April 2023 aimed at strengthening police cooperation between the two countries. The act provides for the exchange of information, the carrying out of investigations and joint operational activities, as well as the exchange of police officers and administrative employees.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.policiacivil.sp.gov.br\/portal\/faces\/pages_home\/noticias\/noticiasDetalhes?collectionId=358412565221033554&contentId=UCM_044799&rascunhoNoticia=0&_adf.ctrl-state=lk3gj77d3_29&_afr=&_afrLoop=3457996341067817#!","https:\/\/transito.mg.gov.br\/sobre-o-detran\/sala-de-imprensa\/noticias\/pcmg-realiza-intercambio-com-a-policia-chinesa-e-assina-memorando-de-cooperacao-policial","https:\/\/www.gov.br\/pf\/pt-br\/assuntos\/noticias\/2023\/04\/pf-firma-acordo-de-cooperacao-policial-internacional-com-a-china"],"note":"","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},{"number":"94","score":"0","grading":"1","evidence":"No evidence was found of organized local criminal groups who threatened or used violence to coerce, intimidate or punish Chinese dissidents.
