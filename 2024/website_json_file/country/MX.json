This situation reflects the growing ties between Mexico and China in the cultural and social sphere, which in turn is a reflection of the flexibility that the PRC has to carry out a \u201cSociety-Society\u201d relationship beyond the traditional \u201cState\u201d approach. This reflects the fct that, in addition to the economic strategy, Xi Jinping's government also applies a soft power policy towards Mexico, with the purpose of improving its image, but also with the idea of strengthening\/creating new ties of integration.","Mexico's geographical position (North America) and economic structure make it possible for the country to continue to be an important market for China. It should be remembered that being part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (T-MEC), the northern part of the country offers unique opportunities (apart from low-cost labor) for Chinese companies - especially in the automotive sector - to establish factories bordering the United States. However, we have noticed that in recent years, the former Head of Government and more than likely future president Claudia Shienbaum has signed contracts with Chinese companies to renew the urban railway system in the Mexican capital. In summary, China is expected to continue increasing its investments in the country beyond the aforementioned northern region.","In the field of foreign policy, it is observed that Mexico remains attached to its traditional doctrine of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, including China. For this reason we note the country's position of neutrality in delicate diplomatic matters for China. A relevant aspect is that greater closeness in diplomatic matters has been observed during the past government of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto than in the one presided over by Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO).","The results of the \u201cTechnology\u201d Domain are striking because China has managed to articulate a strategy to insert itself into the country's telecommunications sector, but also to ensure a market niche in the provision of intelligence and mass surveillance services.","Alleged fentanyl exports from China have become a prominent issue on the bilateral agenda. Such has been the impact that both Xi Jinping and AMLO have publicly addressed the issue. Until now, beyond the initial accusations, both countries have addressed this issue in the diplomatic sphere."],"description-1":"In 2023, Mexico had a GDP per capita of US$13,926 and a total population of 128.46 million people.","description-2":"Mexico established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1972.
