This means that the Russian Federation can adopt China's practices in citizen control, privacy, freedom of expression, media censorship, and so on. In addition to regular meetings of foreign ministers during reciprocal visits and on the sidelines of international forums, there is a system of scheduled consultations between the Russian and Chinese foreign ministries at the level of deputy ministers and department heads. The Russia-China nexus has firmly established itself as a key factor in maintaining international security and stability, establishing a multipolar world order, democratizing global governance mechanisms, and ensuring the rule of international law. At various levels of government, approvals of China's policies are expressed, and they are mostly positive.","Russian-Chinese relations are officially defined by the parties as relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation entering a new era. Its basic principles and directions of development are reflected in the Treaty on Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the PRC of July 16, 2001. In total, more than 300 intergovernmental treaties and agreements have been concluded, covering practically all areas of cooperation. The Treaty of Good-Neighborliness defined the basic principle of bilateral relations: China and Russia have always lived in friendship and will never be enemies. Russia has also reaffirmed its commitment to the one China principle and opposes Taiwan independence in any form. This is disclosed in the joint statement on deepening relations of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation between the Russian Federation and the PRC into a new era.","The ideas of Sovereignization of the Runet (Russian Internet) are already closer to the ideas of the PRC\u2019s Golden Shield, although it currently operates in a limited mode - and only in relation to those resources that pose the greatest threat to the Kremlin. But blocking and restrictions on VPN use are increasingly looking like the Chinese version of regulation.","After the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions by the US, Europe and their allies, Moscow redirected significant volumes of oil and coal to China. Chinese companies increased their exports to Russia, taking advantage of the withdrawal of many Western companies from the Russian market. Thus, by the end of 2022, trade turnover between the two countries increased by almost 30%, reaching a record $190.3 billion. For example, Chinese exports of goods to Russia increased by 12.8% to $76.1 billion, while imports from Russia increased by 43.4% to $114.1 billion. In 2023, after the introduction of a number of sanctions from the West, including a ban on the export of devices over $200 to Russia. China significantly increased imports of Chinese mobile phones into Russia, which are now distributed with pre-installed Russian application stores (RuStores). Now Chinese manufacturers occupy 75% of the mobile device market, which is 25% more than a year earlier. It is obvious that control over devices imported into the country with pre-installed and government-approved applications allows for increased control and censorship in the Russian online space.","The Chairman of the Supreme Council of United Russia, Boris Gryzlov, announced at a joint event with the Communist Party of China the creation of a platform for \"international party interaction\" at the Russian State Social University, at which a social rating system similar to the Chinese one is being developed. The platform will be called the International Center for Sustainable Development. In his speech, Boris Gryzlov said that the purpose of the International Center will be to \"unite supporters of the multipolar world\" and preserve traditional values. \"We see how the multipolar architecture of international relations takes on clearer and clearer contours,\" he said."],"description-1":"In 2023, Russia had a GDP per capita of US$13,817 and a total population of 145.68 million people.","description-2":"The Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on October 2, 1949.
