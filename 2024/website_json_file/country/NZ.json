PRC propaganda is not effective or credible if it appears in mainstream English media.","New Zealand appears to have moved away from military cooperation with the PRC, and legislation around the use and export of sensitive technologies has made it more difficult for the PRC to gain inroads in these areas, agreements that have been made in the past related to military cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative are theoretically still in place but are not being acted upon.","The main vectors for PRC influence in New Zealand are related to the country's continued economic dependence on the PRC, and manifested in trade relationships, academic relationships and sister city relationships, Memorandums of Understanding and agreements around research collaborations are still being made, and such activities are encouraged by the provisions of the New Zealand-China Free Trade Agreement Upgrade, which entered into force in 2022.","New Zealand public opinion has largely soured on China, the principal supporters of closer engagement who remain either focus on the importance of New Zealand's economic relationship wth the PRC because of business interests. Although they do exist, there are relatively few commentators in New Zealand at present who will openly praise the PRC, and their opinions are not widely broadcasted in the mainstream media."],"description-1":"In 2023, New-Zealand had a GDP per capita of US$48,528 and a total population of 5.15 million people.","description-2":"New-Zealand established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1972.
