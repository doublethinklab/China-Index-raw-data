These associations and clans have access to parts of the local ethnic Chinese community, and their leaders often overlap with the grassroots of the long-dominant People's Action Party, providing some access to ministers and members of parliament. The 'few, significant' rating is assigned because these organizations in Singapore function similarly to other 'Promotion of Peaceful Reunification' groups, even if they do not use the same name. The naming convention is likely a way to circumvent Singapore's restrictions on registering politically oriented organizations, particularly those with overseas links.

These remarks are typically made in Chinese and predominantly targeted at areas with a large Chinese population. Since these organisations claim to represent the British Chinese community, they have enjoyed some engagement from local and even national political figures, and from business leaders and other public figures. Pro-CCP campaigning has in some instances led to violence and threats against dissidents, including Hongkongers, Tibetans, and Uyghurs. For example, a purported 'anti-racism' rally set up by pro-CCP groups in London's Chinatown involved the dissemination of false narratives about Xinjiang and degenerated into a brawl when pro-democracy Hongkongers, who arrived to oppose the rally, were attacked by rally supporters. Given the regularity of such incidents and the disproportionate effect they have towards relevant discussions within the British Chinese diaspora, this Indicator deserves the 'More than a few' and 'Significant' ratings.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.ukpcrs.com\/","https:\/\/www.fmprc.gov.cn\/gjhdq_676201\/gj_676203\/oz_678770\/1206_679906\/1206x2_679926\/202209\/t20220922_10769839.shtml.","http:\/\/gb.china-embassy.gov.cn\/sgxw\/202207\/t20220701_10714023.htm.","http:\/\/www.oushinet.com\/static\/content\/weekly\/english\/2023-03-20\/1087385992912453632.html"],"note":"","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by Leo Shaw, and has been reviewed by Sam Dunning and Andrew Yeh"},"AU":{"number":"67","score":"3","evidence":"The Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China (ACPPRC) was founded in 2000.

While such remarks exist almost exclusively in Chinese media and may not represent the views of Chinese Australians, the ACPPRC engages with Members of Parliament in private and its members regularly attend fundraising events, seeking to engage with political campaigns.
