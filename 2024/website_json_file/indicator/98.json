Many of these people chose to come to Taiwan under the \"anti-communist hero\"(\u53cd\u5171\u7fa9\u58eb) context, and are seeking for better economic condition or more freedoms than they had in China. However, if Mainland Affairs Council doesn't find them with facts of dissident actions in China or immediate danger from the Chinese government, they would be deported back to China. Also, since Taiwan doesn't have Refugee Act at the moment, the Chinese dissidents in Taiwan usually don't have a legal status, and would only be able to stay in Taiwan under the status of \"detention alternatives\"(\u6536\u5bb9\u66ff\u4ee3). They might be deported back to China if they're casuing extra risks to the government and\/or breaking the laws.\nhttps:\/\/www.bbc.com\/zhongwen\/trad\/chinese-news-39641355\nhttps:\/\/www.bbc.com\/zhongwen\/trad\/chinese-news-56997296\nhttps:\/\/www.rti.org.tw\/news\/view\/id\/2085967","grading":"0","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},"BR":{"number":"98","score":"0","evidence":"","evidence_urls":[],"note":"","grading":"0","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},"CZ":{"number":"98","score":"0","evidence":"","evidence_urls":[],"note":"","grading":"0","answerer":"Answered by 2 anonymous experts, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},"EE":{"number":"98","score":"0","evidence":"There is no observation of the indicator phenomenon.","evidence_urls":[],"note":"","grading":"0","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},"PL":{"number":"98","score":"4","evidence":"There were recently (jn last 2-3 years) several cases of Taiwan nationals either deported or awaiting deportation from Poland to China.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/safeguarddefenders.com\/en\/blog\/wanted-china-europe-failing-safe-haven-chinese-dissidents"],"note":"","grading":"0","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},"VN":{"number":"98","score":"0","evidence":"Vietnam has ratified an extradition treaty with the PRC in 2020.
