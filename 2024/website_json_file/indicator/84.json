November 2023  Article 3: Although Algeria does not have an allied relationship with either China or Russia, in contrast to Russia and Syria, it is important to note that Algeria has participated in multinational military manoeuvres in which China has also taken part, and hence said activity should be listed in this article. The Panamax 2022 manoeuvres, held from 12 to 27 August 2022 in Venezuela, allowed military personnel from both countries, as well as contingents from Russia, Belarus, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Uzbekistan and Venezuela to share resources and procedures and become familiar with one another.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.alaraby.co.uk\/politics\/%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%83%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AB-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B2-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%AD","https:\/\/aawsat.com\/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A\/%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A7\/4668396-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%84-%C2%AB%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%91%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%C2%BB"],"note":"","grading":"0","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by Filip Noubel"},"FR":{"number":"84","score":"0","evidence":"","evidence_urls":[],"note":"","grading":"0","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by Filip Noubel"},"BD":{"number":"84","score":"0","evidence":"We could not get definite information about any military training in 2023 participated by Bangladesh forces.
