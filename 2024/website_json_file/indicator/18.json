Mr. Papuashvili stated that the chairperson of Civic IDEA, Tinatin Khidasheli presented herself to the public as a prominent China expert, though with a \u201chostile rhetoric\u201d towards the PRC, aiming at \u201cfueling anti-Chinese sentiments and serving the interests of the unrecognized state of Taiwan\u201d.\nDuring the interview, he noted that the organization Civic IDEA is financed by a Taiwanese NGO\u2013 \u201cTaiwan Foundation for Democracy\u201d, and stated that there is also \u201canother foundation in Taiwan that receives funding from the organization\u201d.
