Professor Steve Tsang, former head of the University of Nottingham School of Contemporary Chinese Studies (SCCS), said recently in a Channel 4 documentary that the SCCS was shut down in 2016 in response to pressure from Beijing. Tsang has openly criticised the CCP on several occasions and accused the university management of asking him not to speak to the media during Xi's visit to the UK in 2015. While this case is significant, it falls outside of the reporting period, justifying a 'No' response.\n\nIt must be said that the pressure exerted on academics cannot be reflected adequately by 'hard' evidence of coercion. The ambiguity of what is acceptable or not creates fear and confusion comparable to or more significant thatn any single high-profile case. The 'case' classification of evidence also makes it difficult to take into account the long-lasting impact of reported cases.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-tyne-56545200","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/education\/2023\/nov\/28\/china-influencing-leading-british-universities-documentary-claims","https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2021\/mar\/26\/china-sanctions-uk-businesses-mps-and-lawyers-in-xinjiang-row#:~:text=China%20imposes%20sanctions%20on%20UK%20MPs%2C%20lawyers%20and%20academic%20in%20Xinjiang%20row,-This%20article%20is&text=China%20has%20imposed%20sanctions%20on,human%20rights%20abuses%20in%20Xinjiang."],"note":"","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by Leo Shaw, and has been reviewed by Sam Dunning and Andrew Yeh"},"AU":{"number":"31","score":"0","evidence":"The latest reported case of the PRC banning Australian scholars from entering China was when Clive Hamilton and Alex Joske's visas for China were revoked in 2020.
