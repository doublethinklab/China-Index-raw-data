While this was reported in December 2023, the breaches have started as far back as 2015. In August 2023, it was reported that Russian and Chinese hackers have breached the Foreign Office's internal systems, which gave the access to the day-to-day business of the government department. In 2020 and 2021, the UK and its allies repeatedly condemend China for conducting malicious cyber activity. In 2022, the MI5 and the FBI held a joint press conference warning Western businesses of the cyber security threat posed by the CCP. There is, therefore, reason to rate this Indicator as 'More than a few'.\n\nGiven the attacks may have breached Sellafield's system and have breached the Foreign Office's system, the sensitive nature of the targets warrants a 'Significant' rating.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2023\/dec\/04\/sellafield-nuclear-site-hacked-groups-russia-china","https:\/\/inews.co.uk\/news\/russian-chinese-hackers-foreign-office-cyber-attack-secret-public-2541644","https:\/\/globalnews.ca\/news\/10148825\/britain-denies-sellafield-nuclear-site-cyber-attack-report\/","https:\/\/www.ncsc.gov.uk\/news\/uk-condemns-chinese-cyber-attacks-against-businesses-governments","https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/uk-and-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-a-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking","https:\/\/lordslibrary.parliament.uk\/china-security-challenges-to-the-uk\/#heading-4"],"note":"","grading":"0","answerer":"Answered by Leo Shaw, and has been reviewed by Sam Dunning and Andrew Yeh"},"AU":{"number":"95","score":"4","evidence":"Evidence shows that the Australian government has been targeted by cyber espionage campaigns from the PRC aimed at extracting sensitive information, including defense and energy.
