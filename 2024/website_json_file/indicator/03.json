Therefore, this indicator deserves a 'Few' rating. \n\nLee and Oli Barrett, two of the participants of the initiative, run a Youtube channel named 'Barrett' with 368 thousand subscribers. Adam McIlmoyle, another British participant in the initiative, runs a channel named 'The China Adventure' with 1.43 thousand subscribers. While they may not be the most popular channels on Youtube, their videos conform with narratives that the PRC government promotes. The Barretts have echoed the PRC's rhetoric on the Israel-Gaza conflict and Xinjiang in a recent video. McIlmoyle has also published a video recording his tour in Xinjiang. Their content thus justifies a 'Significant' rating.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/cn.chinadaily.com.cn\/a\/202207\/28\/WS62e27a03a3101c3ee7ae1460.html","http:\/\/www.scio.gov.cn\/dfwx\/dfwx_2194\/202211\/t20221111_619701.html","https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DUvl-AAf5gM"],"note":"","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by Leo Shaw, and has been reviewed by Sam Dunning and Andrew Yeh"},"AU":{"number":"03","score":"1","evidence":"In 2023, the PRC organised the \u201cMy Story of Chinese Hanzi\u201d international competition in Australia for influencers who \"promote cultural understanding and friendship between China and Australia\".
