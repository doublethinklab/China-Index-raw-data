Republika Srpska insists on signing an interstate agreement between BiH and China, in order to implement infrastructure projects. For now, this was not possible, because there was no consent of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This did not stop RS entity from pursuing their own economic interests with China, independently of the BiH state level government. The Chinese bank Exim is ready to finance the largest infrastructure projects in the Republic of Srpska, including the construction of sections of the future highway Belgrade - Banja Luka. The Chinese state company for the construction of roads and railways, \"Shandong\", has been present in Serbia for a long time, and in 2018, it opened a subsidiary company \"SDHS-CSI BH\" in Banja Luka (Republika Srpska). They also signed a concession contract for the construction of the Banjaluka-Prijedor highway with the Government of the RS. In the end of 2023, it was announced that Chinese companies, which submitted bids for the construction of the Buk Bijela hydroelectric plant (Drina river), requested additional guarantees from the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (i.e. RS entity) to sign a contract for this project worth 250 million euros.

Additionally, there are some indicative examples which suggest that China may target government and potentially sub-government officials, in order to promote agreements. In 2018, the Municipality of the Greek city of Kalamata, had signed a contract with the Greek telecommunications company \"Wind\" for the establishment of a 5G network, provided by Huawei. This project, however, wasn't supported by the Municipality alone and was promoted by then leftist government of SYRIZA. It was canceled after the intervention of the US government, which issued a national security concern on a European level that led to the banning of Huawei from the European Internet network and 5G services. It should also be noted, that, in 2018, Huawei was assigned with the project of modernizing the Port of Piraeus Authority (PPA) network infrastructure, establishing a private network. Even though the above cases do not apply to the parameters of the indicator, they constitute indicative examples of China's attempts to approach politicians and members of the sub-national government in order to promote its agendas, revealing also the fact that technology is a major 'tool' for said policy.","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},"MK":{"number":"34","score":"1","evidence":"In June 2023 Skopje's Karposh municipality [which is one of the biggest urban municipalities in the capital Skopje] and its head, Stevco Jakimovski, sign\u0435d a cooperation memorandum with the Confucius Institute that will allow school children to learn the Chinese language.

The Welsh government has also historically signed agreements with parts of the Chinese government. The Bristol & West of England China Bureau, founded by individuals with an interest in China, has also frequently engaged with the Guangzhou Municipal Government and Guangdong Provincial Government. Bristol has a sister city agreement with Guangzhou. Therefore, this Indicator deserves a 'More than a few' rating. \n\nWhile the significance of some of these initiatives is questionable, entities such as the Manchester China Forum and Chinese participation in the Midlands Engine serve to deepen and lock in economic ties between the UK and China at the local level. Such partnerships and institutions also cover a wide range of sectors including education, tourism, and sports.

In 2023, Tourism WA and Sichuan Airlines signed an MOU aimed at developing more flights. Meanwhile, WA Museum, WA Museum Foundation, and Chinese investor Tianqi Lithium signed a second MOU to strengthen sustainable development and cultural cooperation. \n\nThe state of Victoria also signed a nonbinding MoU with the NDRC in 2018 and a nonbinding Framework Agreement in 2019.
