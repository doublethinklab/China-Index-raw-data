It was fined as it was never submitted for approval.

In 2010, Frank Wu, the member of Control Yuan (the investigatory and auditory institute of Taiwanese government), raised a corrective measures against Mainland Affairs Council. In the report, it mentioned that 2 major Taiwanese newspapers United News and China Times has embedded advertisement about multiple Chinese provinces in their news articles, and has contracts with the provincial governments for the deals.

And in August 2019, an investigation report of Reuters revealed with proof that, China has brought at least 5 Taiwanese media, and use them to push forward their propaganda to the Taiwanese audience. From the documents that the journalist have reviewed, most of the contracts are from the Taiwan Affairs Office. But there are also a few contracts from other government sectors, such as the government of a southern province. There is also frequent exposure of the advertisement of Chinese state media on social media. Since those websites\/applications are banned in China, it's clear that the ads are targeted at foreign viewers.
