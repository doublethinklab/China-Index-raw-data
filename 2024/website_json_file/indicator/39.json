In 2020, Chinese envoy in Nepal met with a lot of Nepali governemtn officials at a time when Nepal was in complete political disarray. In 2022, China insisted on sending a vice-minister for a visit despite being told that Nepal was in the midst of federal and provincial polls. In 2023, a close relative of former Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was allegedly involved in an arms deal with China that is being conducted in violation of due process. While the money trail is not so apprarent, China has tried influencing political parties in Nepal.                \nBeginning with local-level politics, where municipal and village-level elections are major units of the decision-making process, Chinese involvement has increased manifold. Last year, municipal elections were conducted in Kathmandu Valley, where an independent candidate, Balendra Sah won in the Mayoral race. During his election campaign, he was often seen with Chinese embassy staff and journalists in several restaurants and it was alleged that enormous Chinese funding was instrumental in his triumph. After he assumed office, he met the Chinese ambassador, Chen Song and during the meeting, in order to pander to the Chinese, he underscored the similarity between festivals, dress, and cuisine of both countries and pitched for a new approach to promote it at the local level. Furthermore, his campaign against street vendors was frowned upon by citizens as the capitalist agenda to make space for Chinese outlets in the valley.\nHowever, Chinese involvement is not restricted to municipal councils but also at the village level. China has propounded one man, one village policy to sway the elections and to give a push to the Chinese propaganda in villages. Apart from this, many Chinese-funded factories are running in places that are in geographical proximity to China, and in some cases, Chinese nationals are the owners. The economic power is showing significant outcomes in elections as these factories are the source of money for political parties. The Chinese are supporting independent candidates also, who could help them after the polls to expand business in many districts.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/news\/international\/former-pm-deubas-relative-involved-in-arms-deal-with-china-nepalese-politician\/article66858508.ece","https:\/\/www.firstpost.com\/world\/china-increases-activities-in-nepal-as-maoist-govt-takes-over-12061952.html","https:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/opinion\/here-s-why-china-is-financing-local-elections-in-nepal\/story-KFMsNEcGxX8u2Sh2BL9ddN.html","https:\/\/www.tibetanreview.net\/chinas-election-interference-move-gets-nepali-rebuffs\/","https:\/\/www.financialexpress.com\/business\/defence-mapping-chinas-growing-influence-at-local-level-in-nepal-what-india-can-do-3186481\/"],"note":"","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by Sriparna Pathak, and has been reviewed by Amish Mulmi"},"RU":{"number":"39","score":"0","evidence":"","evidence_urls":[],"note":"","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 3 anonymous experts."},"NZ":{"number":"39","score":"3","evidence":"This is the most famous recent case - though it is not absolutely clear whether this money originated in the PRC, hence the low confidence rating\n\n","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.stuff.co.nz\/national\/politics\/132321845\/nzbased-ccp-state-media-publisher-donated-more-than-18000-to-national-party"],"note":"","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by Catherine Churchman, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},"ZW":{"number":"39","score":"4","evidence":"The CCP has pledged to support ZANU PF ideologically and financially and the two parties have signed agreements for strengthening their relations and cooperation","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.thezimbabwemail.com\/zimbabwe\/china-gives-zanu-pf-piles-of-rice-for-election-campaign\/"],"note":"","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by Ernest Mudzengi and 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by Andronicus Sikula and Dr. Obert Hodzi"},"CD":{"number":"39","score":"na","evidence":"Based on experience, research and access to certain political circles and chinese companies, I do know that some of them have financed electoral campaign for some DRC politicians.

She also targeted former Labour MP Andrew Dismore and Liberal Democrat Party leader Sir Ed Davey. In 2023, the Home Office barred the entry of a Chinese couple associated with Christine Lee, as they had made CCP-backed donations to British politicians. Additionally, All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) serve as a convenient conduit for Chinese donations.
