This prevented Makedonski Telekom, owned ultimately by Deutsche Telecom, from purchasing equipment from Huawei for its 5G network. Thus, while in the past telecoms have signed such agreements for 3G and 4G equipment, they are now prohibited from doing so as 5G is about to be rolled out. Consequently, in 2022 Makedonski Telekom launched its 5G network but the equipment was purchased from Ericsson. It was the same case with the second telecom provider, A1, which is owned by Austrian Telecom, which also purchased its equipment from Ericsson.\nHowever, the extent of the use of previously purchased Chinese 3G and 4G equipment by telecom operators is not fully clear. The regulatory body, the Agency for Electronic Communications, AEK, in 2022 and in 2023 said that the intent is for this equipment to be gradually phased out by the operators by the end of 2023. The operators however are reluctant to speak in detail about the pace of this process and whether it has been completed. So in essence there is circumstantial evidence that operators no longer purchase 4G equipment from Chinese producers and are phasing out the old equipment, but there is no way to verify that for sure.
