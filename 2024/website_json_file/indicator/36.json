Cagayan province Governor Manuel Mamba was invited by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (a United Front-affiliate) to visit China in May 2023. Mamba was among the few Philippine officials who oppose the construction of new PH-US Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement sites in his  province. With the level of influence of the personalities who visited China, therefore, this Indicator deserves a \"Significant\" rating.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/malaya.com.ph\/news_news\/bbm-hopes-duterte-xi-talks-included-south-china-sea-row\/","http:\/\/laoag.china-consulate.gov.cn\/eng\/yhwl\/spc\/202305\/t20230529_11085225.htm"],"note":"","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 4 anonymous experts."},"TH":{"number":"36","score":"1","evidence":"Visits by Thai officials to China and vice versa are frequent.
