Some US news organizations such as National Geographic and Discovery Channel are also members of the Belt and Road Media Cooperation Union. Therefore, this Indicator deserves a \"Few\" rating. However, the United States is not a member of the BRI, and US views toward the BRI and China's foreign policy are broadly negative. Therefore, this Indicator deserves an \"Insignificant\" rating.\n","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/sinopsis.cz\/en\/rolland-bri-influence-operations\/","https:\/\/efile.fara.gov\/ords\/fara\/f?p=1381:11:2230512195999::NO::P11_CNTRY:CH","https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/global\/2023\/07\/27\/chinas-approach-to-foreign-policy-gets-largely-negative-reviews-in-24-country-survey\/"],"note":"","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},"DE":{"number":"02","score":"0","evidence":"There are none as Germany has yet again (January 2023) denied to be a BRI country.

Therefore, this Indicator deserves a 'Few' rating. DMGT's major subsidiary, MailOnline, boasts a substantial audience. However, the recent coverage of the Belt and Road Initiative by MailOnline is limited and not necessarily favourable to the PRC. The limited and somewhat unfavourable coverage results in relatively low significance, justifying an 'Insignificant' rating.","evidence_urls":["https:\/\/www.dmgt.com\/","https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-10956233\/G7-takes-Chinas-Belt-Road-Leaders-600billion-plan-aimed-countering-Beijing.html","http:\/\/en.brnn.com\/n3\/2019\/0425\/c415308-9571930.html"," http:\/\/en.brnn.com\/n3\/2019\/0425\/c415308-9571930.html","https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-10956233\/G7-takes-Chinas-Belt-Road-Leaders-600billion-plan-aimed-countering-Beijing.html"],"note":"","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by Leo Shaw, and has been reviewed by Sam Dunning and Andrew Yeh"},"AU":{"number":"02","score":"2","evidence":"Although no Australian media outlet is affiliated with the organizations mentioned in the indicator, many local Australian Chinese media outlets, such as ACB News, were invited to the Australian Chinese Language Media 'One Belt, One Road' Forum hosted by China News Service Australia in 2017.
