Before the Silk Road Think Tank Network (SiLKS) website link expired, three UK organizations could be found as partners: Chatham House, the Institute of Development Studies, and the 48 Group Club. At the university level, the Global Institute for Silk Roads Studies is affiliated with the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), in collaboration with the UK and Malaysia campuses, as well as its partners in China. Its advisory board includes a diverse array of PRC official institutions. Also, Lancaster University and its four overseas campuses, including China, have established the Belt and Road Initiative Research Consortium. Its conferences are usually hosted by the Confucius Institute, with invitations extended to Chinese diplomats and scholars. Therefore, this Indicator deserves a 'More than a few' rating.  Although relevant events have been held, there is no sufficient evidence of significant results from the above partnerships. Therefore, this Indicator deserves an 'Insignificant' rating.
