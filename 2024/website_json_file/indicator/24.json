A research report dubbed \"Understanding the tools, narratives and influence of Chinese 'soft power' in North Macedonia\" by the author Ana Krstinovska, which was published by ESTIMA and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation near the end of 2022, points out that probably the most important long-term tool for strengthening Chinese soft power in North Macedonia is the opening of this institute. This has resulted in gradual but constant increase of studentrs who learn or have learned the Chinese language and culture which currenlty accounts for several hundred people. Therefore, this indicator deserves a \"Significant\" rating.","evidence_urls":["http:\/\/nubsk.edu.mk\/uslugi\/za-korisnici\/institut-konfucij","https:\/\/estima.mk\/static\/c2.2a1.15_xgjv9t3kenqsccsdmit8\/s1\/files\/rte\/documents\/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B5%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%2C%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%20%D0%B8%20%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%9C%20%D0%B2%D0%BE%20%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%20_%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0_mail.pdf"],"note":"Aditionally, sources tell us that Confucius classrooms do exist in a number of municipalities across the country but according to this source they offer only language classes.","grading":"1","answerer":"Answered by 1 anonymous expert, and has been reviewed by another 1 anonymous expert."},"TR":{"number":"24","score":"4","evidence":"There are four Confucius Institutes and two Confucius Classrooms at Turkey\u2019s most prestigious universities and schools.
