        "The significant investment from the People's Republic of China, particularly in infrastructure projects in Republika Srpska, showcases the growing economic ties between China and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The focus on Republika Srpska highlights an evolving regional dynamic closer aligned with Chinese interests in Serbia.",
        "The presence of Xinhua Chinese news agency raises questions about media influence and perception. Despite operating relatively under the radar, its dual function as a news agency and a perceived tool of Chinese government propaganda challenges its credibility and acceptance within the liberal views dominant in the region.",
        "The establishment of a Department for Chinese Language and Culture at the University of East Sarajevo, along with annual training visits for civil servants organized by the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, highlights a growing cultural and educational exchange between Bosnia and Herzegovina \u2013 RS (Republican Party) entities mainly \u2013 and China.",
        "The strategic partnership between the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and the Communist Party of China underlines a deeper political engagement beyond economic ties. Such partnerships indicate a broader geopolitical alignment and cooperation between certain political entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (again, mainly in RS) and China, potentially influencing policy decisions and regional dynamics.",
        "Bosnia and Herzegovina's involvement in international statements concerning human rights issues in China, despite protests from the Chinese Embassy, reflects the country's position within the broader context of international relations and adherence to human rights principles. This engagement showcases Bosnia and Herzegovina's state-level institutions' willingness to align with international norms and values, despite potential diplomatic pressures."

The proposed statement outlined the continued deterioration of human rights records in Xin jiang, Hong Kong and Tibet. The two missions presented a statement to the Council and sought the support of Bosnia and Herzegovina through diplomatic channels. They suggested that Bosnia and Herzegovina, having previously joined the statement at the third UN Committee in 2020, and in accordance with established practice, follows the positions of EU countries in joining the said statement. Bosnia and Herzegovina eventually co-signed the statement, and the Chinese Embassy in Sarajevo protested this decision strongly and on multiple occasions, urging the Bosnian side to remain neutral and not to interfere in China\u2019s internal matters. They called for the preservation and application of true multilateralism as the right direction to address today\u2019s complex issues, and a way to effectively address traditional and non-traditional security challenges.

According to data from the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Chinese investors invest more in the Republika Srpska entity than in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity. Republika Srpska insists on signing an interstate agreement between BiH and China, in order to implement infrastructure projects. For now, this was not possible, because there was no consent of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This did not stop RS entity from pursuing their own economic interests with China, independently of the BiH state level government. The Chinese bank Exim is ready to finance the largest infrastructure projects in the Republic of Srpska, including the construction of sections of the future highway Belgrade - Banja Luka. The Chinese state company for the construction of roads and railways, \"Shandong\", has been present in Serbia for a long time, and in 2018, it opened a subsidiary company \"SDHS-CSI BH\" in Banja Luka (Republika Srpska). They also signed a concession contract for the construction of the Banjaluka-Prijedor highway with the Government of the RS. In the end of 2023, it was announced that Chinese companies, which submitted bids for the construction of the Buk Bijela hydroelectric plant (Drina river), requested additional guarantees from the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (i.e. RS entity) to sign a contract for this project worth 250 million euros. It is a joint project of Elektroprivreda Srbije and Elektroprivreda Republika Srpska, the hydroelectric plant should be built by one of the three Chinese companies that submitted bids a few months ago - Dongfang Electric Corporation, Power China and Energy China. \n",
