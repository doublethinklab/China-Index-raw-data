        "The Netherlands is by tradition a China-hawk country in terms of diplomacy, domestic politics and social attitudes. There are hardly any leading politicians who avoid criticizing the PRC\u2019s human rights record. Mass media is also largely critical with the regime in Beijing, even those journalists who have been invited on tours in the PRC.",
        "Chinese investments do exist in critical infrastructure, such as sea ports, but their growth and influence are blocked as a results of measures taken at the EU level.",
        "PRC influence in Technology used to be substantial, but it has diminished recently. Exports of sensitive technology made in Netherlands, for instance industrial equipment for advanced chip making, have been blocked by decision of the government. Telecom equipment supplied by PRC-related entities in the past will be provided from different sources.",
        "Academia was a strong lever of influence in the past, as significant university research programs existed in technology, plus cultural connections through the Confucius institutes. However a solid tradition of transparency and media scrutiny have mitigated the risks of undue influence, as the image of PRC has deteriorated globally."
