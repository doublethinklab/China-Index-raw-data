        "The impact of the June 2020 border clashes between India and PRC has dramatically changed the relationship and continues to play a major role in defining the relationship between the PRC and India. That incident has had major impacts on all Domains and has significantly reduced the footprint of the PRC in India.",

For example: Hikvision operates India as Prama Hikvision India Private Ltd and Prama also operates as Prama India, omitting mention of Hikvision and operates with taglines like, \"Made for India, Made by India, Made in India\"."

To counter this, the government is actively working on different initiatives and developing indigenous core technologies for strengthening the fiber optics. India manufactures 100 million fiber km every year. In comparison to manufacturing capacity, the domestic annual consumption of fiber optic is less than half of manufacturing capacity 46 million fiber km. 16 Million FKM of Optical fibers has been exported annually to more than 100 countries in the last three years. Over the years, the country has not only emerged as a manufacturing hub for optical fiber but also as a world exporter of high quality optical fiber to advanced economies in Europe, Americas and other regions across the globe.",
