The move is just the latest sign of a growing partnership between Minsk and Beijing, including in the security realm. Though China and Belarus established relations 25 years ago, ties have been strengthening in recent years. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko upgraded relations to the level of a comprehensive strategic partnership, an endeavor first announced in 2013. (see below URL 1)\n\nOn July 3 Belarus marked 73 years since Minsk was liberated from the Nazis by Soviet forces. The public holiday was accompanied by a requisite military parade. The event served as a reminder of a growing reliance on China as a would-be ally. Another Chinese 4\u00d74 spotted in the July 3 parade is the VN3\/VN4. Deliveries of this particular armored car only began in mid-2017 and it\u2019s further proof that internal security is a serious preoccupation for the Lukashenko regime. The VN3\/VN4 is designed to carry at least eight passengers behind its cab. A roof hatch supports a turret and in Belarusian service it\u2019s armed with a manually operated 12.7mm NSV machine gun in a cupola.
