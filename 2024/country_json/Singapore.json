        "Singapore remains highly exposed to PRC influence in all the segments listed for the China Index. It seems that its military is relatively better shielded. This may be due to a heavy reliance on US and NATO equipment, which restricts what Singapore can reveal to potential US adversaries like the PRC.",
        "The level of exposure coupled with the relative opacity of Singapore's political system, especially the People's Action Party, may expose Singapore to a higher but publicly difficult to ascertain level of pressure or risk from compromises to its political process. This is despite the presence of a law like the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act; the lack of public transparency requirements thereof may prove to be a major limitation.",
        "Singapore society may be particularly susceptible to PRC pressure and disinformation given the limited emphasis on national-level values and principles, coupled with the saturation of PRC-related media and even apparent PRC penetration of Singapore state-owned media.",
        "The Singapore state appears to shy away from publicly taking positions that the PRC does not like, but it is unclear whether this is due to self-censorship based on awareness of high levels of exposure to potential PRC pressure, or if it is a result of direct PRC pressure. At any rate, such positions may increase the risk for the US and its allies working closely with Singapore on sensitive issues or sharing sensitive technology.",
        "More and more PRC-related firms appear to be using Singapore as a platform for their commercial activities. This borrows Singapore's generally positive global repuation as well as the access afforded by Singapore's many trade and investment agreements around the world. Other partners may need to scrutinize investment from Singapore more closely for potential PRC-related risks going forward.",
        "Some of Singapore's economic exposure to the PRC comes from its role as an economic conduit between the PRC and other jurisdictions, this lucrative role for Singapore may grow and exposure increase with more scrutiny over PRC technology and activities in Europe, North America, Northeast Asia (less the PRC), and Oceania. Not all such exposure is nefarious, but they increase the risk of Singapore serving as a proxy for PRC interests."

Informal reports suggest that the CSSA and\/or its affiliates have harassed faculty and others through formal complaint mechanisms at universities. This allegedly occurs when faculty address sensitive issues such as Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet, and the South China Sea. In 2019, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) circulated a memo to faculty and staff, instructing them not to refer to Taiwan and Hong Kong in ways that could be construed as recognizing them as countries. No other university in Singapore has issued a similar directive. It is suspected that the change was the result of internal pressure. NTU has yet to rescind or supersede the directive. To err on the side of caution, given the lack of direct evidence, I code this measure as 'Yes (More than a few, insignificant).",

Ant Group even has a digital bank.

These associations and clans have access to parts of the local ethnic Chinese community, and their leaders often overlap with the grassroots of the long-dominant People's Action Party, providing some access to ministers and members of parliament. The 'few, significant' rating is assigned because these organizations in Singapore function similarly to other 'Promotion of Peaceful Reunification' groups, even if they do not use the same name. The naming convention is likely a way to circumvent Singapore's restrictions on registering politically oriented organizations, particularly those with overseas links. As a result, there is an emphasis on projecting a cultural and community-focused public image.",
