Five Chinese students passing by began protesting about this. They immediately rushed to remove the poster and engaged in a physical fight, bumping shoulders and pushing and pulling with the Korean students. Instead of taking off the poster, the Chinese students stuck notes on the poster with the five-star red flag (Chinese flag), 'Long live Kim Jong-un', and 'Dokdo is Japanese territory'. Still, the confrontation continued. The number of Chinese students increased over time, reaching about 40 at 5 p.m. The standoff ended when a security guard intervened.",
