The Hebrew service was launched online in 2009 during a visit to Israel by then-Director of the State Council Information Office, Wang Chen. Although the outlet does not broadcast on the radio, it has a social media presence, including a Facebook page with 130,000 followers as of July 2023, and a Hebrew-language website: https:\/\/hebrew.cri.cn\/.\n\nAt the center of CRI\u2019s outreach is Xi Xiaoqi (\u595a\u5578\u742a), deputy editor of the outlet\u2019s Hebrew desk. A young and charismatic Chinese man who speaks fluent Hebrew, he is better known in Israel as \u201cItzik\u201d or \u201cItzik HaSini\u201d (\u201cThe Chinese Itzik\u201d). Xi graduated from the Communication University of China in Beijing in 2009 with a major in Hebrew and joined CRI the same year as its correspondent in Israel. Over time, Xi has emerged as a media personality in his own right, being invited on primetime television talk shows to provide commentary about China. He has garnered a following of 22,600 subscribers on YouTube and 22,000 on Facebook as of July 2023. During the coverage period, local media published profiles and interviews with him, including on Channel 14, Channel 12, and a local podcast hosted by Israeli businessman Amir Gal-Or, titled \"Zman Sin\" (\"China Time\").\n\n\n\n",

Katz immediately tweeted about the threat, writing on May 30th, 2022: \"Needless to say, story ain\u2019t going anywhere.\"\n\nThis was not the first time Katz had heard from the embassy, having received a complaint earlier in May over an op-ed by an exiled Uyghur leader and counter-op-eds by embassy representatives to editorials published in 2021 that were critical of China or its impact on Israel\u2019s relations with the United States.",
