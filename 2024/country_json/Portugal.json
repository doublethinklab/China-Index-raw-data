In the words of the former Minister of Foreign Affairs: \"China is a Partner, but not our Ally\"",
        "The economic relationship is flourishing and includes strategic assets such as China being the biggest stakeholder in the Portuguese Electric Grid Network, amongst other sensitive and important sectors of our economy. Meanwhile, a Strategic Partnership with a Close Dialogue maintained since 2019 is increasingly curtailed by national security considerations such as the exclusion from 5G networks of \"companies that are not from NATO, EU or OECD member-states\" and the EU Critical Raw Materials Act.",
