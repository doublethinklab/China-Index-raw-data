On January 19, the Speaker of Parliament of Georgia, Shalva Papuashvili, during an interview on the Public Broadcaster program \"\"Actual Topics\"\", emphasized the importance of the recent parliamentary delegation's visit to the People\u2019s Republic of China, while attacking the Civic IDEA. Mr. Papuashvili stated that the chairperson of Civic IDEA, Tinatin Khidasheli presented herself to the public as a prominent China expert, though with a \u201chostile rhetoric\u201d towards the PRC, aiming at \u201cfueling anti-Chinese sentiments and serving the interests of the unrecognized state of Taiwan\u201d.\nDuring the interview, he noted that the organization Civic IDEA is financed by a Taiwanese NGO\u2013 \u201cTaiwan Foundation for Democracy\u201d, and stated that there is also \u201canother foundation in Taiwan that receives funding from the organization\u201d. According to Papuashvili, this suggests a deliberate effort on Khidasheli's part to fuel anti-Chinese sentiments in Georgia.                                   https:\/\/www.interpressnews.ge\/ka\/article\/785778-shalva-papuashvili-gansakutrebulad-skandaluria-rodesac-sakartvelos-tavdacvis-qopili-ministri-pinansdeba-separatistuli-rezhimis-mxridan-imistvis-rom-daazianos-sakartvelos-erovnuli-interesebi-chinettan             https:\/\/1tv.ge\/video\/akhali-politikuri-sezoni-stumari-shalva-papuashvili-aqtualuritema-maka-cincadzestan-ertad-live\/                          https:\/\/sputnik-georgia.ru\/20240122\/finansirovanie-gruzinskikh-npo-tayvanskimi-organizatsiyami-nepriemlemo-dlya-vlasti---deputat-285815916.html              \"",
