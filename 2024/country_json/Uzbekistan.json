                "note": "At present, Uzbekistan-China relations have made great progress in the context of the pandemic, and bilateral trade and investment have grown rapidly, he said. The Uzbek president thanked China for providing timely support to Uzbekistan in fighting the pandemic. Mirziyoyev said his country is willing to take the opportunity of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries to formulate a new five-year cooperation plan with China to inject new impetus into bilateral cooperation. http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/asiapacific\/2021-07\/16\/c_1310065247.htm\n\nChina-Uzbek relations began to pick up speed with the appointment of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in 2016. The significant market liberalization and economic reforms implemented by the new president have made the country one of the five fastest growing in the world, giving a boost to bilateral ties as China\u2019s goals for regional development align with Uzbekistan\u2019s economic ambitions. It has also made the country increasingly investor-friendly and more welcoming of Chinese investment than some of its neighbors. In 2020, Uzbekistan upped the number of visa-free days Chinese citizens could enjoy in the country from five to seven to facilitate travel and tourism in the country. The two countries have also deepened cultural exchange. Uzbekistan was the first country in the world to open a Confucius Institute, a Chinese language and cultural institution, and centers for the study of Uzbek language and culture have been set up in Chinese universities. https:\/\/www.china-briefing.com\/news\/china-uzbekistan-bilateral-trade-and-future-outlook\/\n\nAs in the Karimov era, \u201cmultivectorism\u201d remains a mantra in Tashkent, but Mirziyoyev recognizes China\u2019s role in the future of Central Asia. It was the fourth country he visited during his first year\u2019s flurry of international diplomacy, and in 2019, Uzbekistan\u2019s Prime Minister referred to China as Uzbekistan\u2019s \u201cclosest and most reliable partner\u201d. According to the Uzbek Ministry of Finance\u2019s \u201cBudget for Citizens\u201d, the state\u2019s external debt to China amounted to $1.9 billion at the start of 2019, making Beijing Uzbekistan\u2019s largest creditor \u2013 ahead of Japan, which owns $1.5 billion of Uzbekistan\u2019s debt. The Ministry paper predicts a rise to $3 billion in 2020, but Uzbekistan, underleveraged and with growth potential, is not in too precarious a position. http:\/\/aei.pitt.edu\/103197\/1\/ST-DA_Asia_Policy_Brief_Chinas_Footprint_in_Central_Asia.pdf",
