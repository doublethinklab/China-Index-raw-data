        "In Nepal, given its geographic location between India and China, many influence activities from China are undertaken in response to Nepal\u2019s relations with India. The most blatant example is from 2023 when the Chinese envoy to Nepal criticized Nepal\u2019s relations with India. Thus, in several Domains, particularly those that can impact the lives of the ordinary citizen of Nepal \u2013 be it Society, Domestic Politics, or Economy, PRC influence is aimed at proving China is a better partner for Nepal. In 2023, Nepal\u2019s Prime Minister traveled to Beijing and met Chinese Premier Li Qiang. Twelve agreements were signed covering a host of domains, and newer arenas for cooperation \u2013 with the use of AI also discussed. These have not panned out yet in Nepal. Thus, it will be important to see how far the agreements materialize in future.",
        "Local politics remains a crucial factor for China in increasing its influence in Nepal and there are cases of secret arms deals between Chinese counterparts and relatives of former Nepali leaders. While the money trail is not transparent, China has tried influencing political parties in Nepal; at the local level, where municipal and village-level elections are major units of the decision-making process, Chinese involvement has increased manifold. Last year, municipal elections were conducted in Kathmandu Valley, where an independent candidate won in the mayoral race. As reported by Nepal\u2019s media, during his election campaign, he was often seen with Chinese embassy staff and journalists in several restaurants. It was alleged that enormous Chinese funding was instrumental in his triumph. Education, training of officials, and expansion of Chinese language are other important tools for the purpose.",
        "In the context of the Belt and Road Initative and the influence China can exert, it is important to point out that Nepal\u2019s civil society has been at the forefront in trying to push the government for clarity on BRI deals with China. Also, most projects under the BRI have stagnated in Nepal, and there are no visible benefits so far. Nevertheless, given the fillip bilateral relationship received last year after Prachanda\u2019s visit to Beijing, influence in the Economy Domain and the progress of the BRI should be closely observed."

The report notes that \u201cthe Tibetan Buddhist refugee population has faced continued legal impediments to their right to freedom of religion or belief.\u201d These challenges are attributed to the policies and regulations of the Nepalese government, which reportedly constrain and restrict the religious practices of Tibetans, particularly those associated with the Tibetan Buddhist faith. However, no direct statement from 2022 or 2023 by any Nepali official directly supporting China is to be found. The repression takes place silently. In 2022, U.S. Under-Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, who is also the Joe Biden administration\u2019s Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, Uzra Zeya, visited Nepal. She visited the Dalai Lama before going to Nepal. Nepali officials feigned ignorance of Zeya\u2019s meeting with the Tibetan refugees. The foreign ministry spokesperson said the government was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the meetings.",

                "evidence": "In 2017, Beijing announced $1 million towards the country\u2019s local elections. In 2020, Chinese envoy in Nepal met with a lot of Nepali governemtn officials at a time when Nepal was in complete political disarray. In 2022, China insisted on sending a vice-minister for a visit despite being told that Nepal was in the midst of federal and provincial polls. In 2023, a close relative of former Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was allegedly involved in an arms deal with China that is being conducted in violation of due process. While the money trail is not so apprarent, China has tried influencing political parties in Nepal.                \nBeginning with local-level politics, where municipal and village-level elections are major units of the decision-making process, Chinese involvement has increased manifold. Last year, municipal elections were conducted in Kathmandu Valley, where an independent candidate, Balendra Sah won in the Mayoral race. During his election campaign, he was often seen with Chinese embassy staff and journalists in several restaurants and it was alleged that enormous Chinese funding was instrumental in his triumph. After he assumed office, he met the Chinese ambassador, Chen Song and during the meeting, in order to pander to the Chinese, he underscored the similarity between festivals, dress, and cuisine of both countries and pitched for a new approach to promote it at the local level. Furthermore, his campaign against street vendors was frowned upon by citizens as the capitalist agenda to make space for Chinese outlets in the valley.\nHowever, Chinese involvement is not restricted to municipal councils but also at the village level. China has propounded one man, one village policy to sway the elections and to give a push to the Chinese propaganda in villages. Apart from this, many Chinese-funded factories are running in places that are in geographical proximity to China, and in some cases, Chinese nationals are the owners. The economic power is showing significant outcomes in elections as these factories are the source of money for political parties. The Chinese are supporting independent candidates also, who could help them after the polls to expand business in many districts.",
