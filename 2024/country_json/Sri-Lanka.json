        "Sri Lanka-PRC ties in the years 2022-2023 indicate a deviation from past instances of prominent PRC influence across various sectors and this can be largely attributed to the island nation's economic crisis, which initially resulted in China distancing itself from Sri Lanka; going forward, it is likely that many of the decisions that Sri Lanka makes, across China Index Domains, will be in relation to the country's economic recovery, and this includes future engagements with the PRC.",
        "Post-economic-crisis, PRC influence in Sri Lanka can be weighed against that of India's, with both regional superpowers making efforts to protect their own interests in Sri Lanka, especially in the energy and infrastructure development sectors.",
        "Previously, a key feature of PRC influence in Sri Lanka came in the form of unsolicited proposals for mega-development projects that went largely uncontested, something that has not been observed as much in recent years. This could be the result of a more wary populace, who blamed the former Rajapaksa administration's policies (which included very close ties with the PRC) for the country's economic crisis.",
        "The PRC continues to employ soft power tactics and uses religious and cultural ties with Sri Lanka to appeal to the public, especially the majority Sinhalese-speaking people.",
        "One of the challenges faced in verifying responses to Indicators is a lack of available information with regard to some sectors, such as funding and agreements between the PRC and local entities including businesses, education institutions, think tanks and media outlets."
