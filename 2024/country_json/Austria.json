Matthias Euler-Rolle, spokesperson and communications chief at the Federal Chancellery under Faymann, has been responsible for the expansion of Tojoy into the German, Austrian, and Swiss markets since 2017. Moreover, the former Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern (2016 to 2017, SP\u00d6) was selected as the president of the European China Business Council in 2019, which was created by the China Europe Association for Technology and Economic Cooperation (registered under the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Civil Affairs). It was not possible to determine whether he still fills this role. Therefore, this indicator deserves a \"Few\" rating.
