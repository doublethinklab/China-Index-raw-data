        "Taken together, China\u2019s presence in Denmark and ability to influence Danish society is rather low (as compared to a decade ago) following several years of media (as well as judicial) investigation into Danish-Chinese relations, accompanied by a host of new laws and regulation efforts from the Danish authorities to curb PRC influence in Denmark. Also, the general Danish population increasingly holds a negative view on China and the CCP. This is also reflected in critical media coverage on China.",
        "While the Danish government has renewed its Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with China in 2023, institutionalized cooperation between the two sides has been largely reduced to green areas such as climate change, sustainability and the environment.",
        "Research cooperation between Danish universities and Chinese partners has come under scrutiny and pressure in recent years, but some pockets of institutionalized ties remain, notably within the framework of the Sino-Danish Center.",
        "Danish authorities and suppliers of critical infrastructure are currently phasing out Chinese-produced telecom and surveillance equipment, while the Danish Police Intelligence Service has singled out China as one of the primary cyber espionage threats to Denmark.",
        "In general Danish foreign policy has always been focused on Danish businesses and industry. The comprehensive strategic partnership with the PRC has been majorly overhauled after Covid. It now mainly focuses on climate, energy and environmental collaboration. The Sino-Danish Center is also an important part, but this may be due to sunk cost fallacy."
