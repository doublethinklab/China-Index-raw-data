        "The Media Domain is quite interesting as regards Saudi Arabia's cooperation with the PRC. The media reported positive things about relations between the two countries and described relations between the two countries as close friendship, partnership, and brotherhood spanning over 32 years. The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of China also signed cooperation documents with the Radio and Television Supreme Council of Turkey and the General Commission of Audiovisual Media of Saudi Arabia. China Central Television will set up the \"Belt and Road News Alliance\" with mainstream media of relevant countries.",
        "Despite strong ties with Taiwan, Saudi Arabia upholds the one China principle. Saudi Arabia supports the PRC's stance on Xinjiang and Tibet, and cooperates with Hong Kong as a bridge to achieve cooperation with Mainland China, without criticizing China's treatment of Hong Kong.",
        "In the Academia Domain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has implemented the Chinese language in the curriculum at all stages of education in Saudi schools and universities. Besides, the Huawei ICT Academy program partners with the Saudi Digital Academy. Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund also has made its first major foray into the Chinese games market, betting on a Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed esports tournament organizer. On the other hand, KAUST (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology) became a recipient of funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the 973 Program.",
        "In the Technology Domain, Huawei has became a major player in the deployment of 5G networks across the Saudi market (through carriers including Saudi Telecom Company, Mobily, and Zain). Apart from the 5G field, there have been discussions between the two countries on smart-city cooperation and on developing artificial intelligence. Saudi Arabia have also already established initial space cooperation with China. A small camera from the King Abdulaziz City for Science & Technology (KACST) flew on the Longjiang-2 (DSLWP-B) lunar microsatellite launched with a relay satellite for the Chang\u2019e-4 lunar far side landing."

Saudi Arabia bought 50 DF-3 missiles with conventional warheads.\n\nRiyadh since bought 54 PLZ-45 self-propelled guns in 2007, five CH-4B drones in 2014 and more than 30 Wing Loong-1 and 2 armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in 2014 and 2017.\n\nThe CH-4 armed reconnaissance drones have been used in major battlefields in the Yemen war and also recently by the Pakistani forces to fight militants in Balochistan. It was reportedly the most sold item \u2013 up to 300 \u2013 to Saudi Arabia during the Zhuhai Air Show, although the deal has not been confirmed by Riyadh or Beijing.\n\nThe Wing Loong UAV, a medium-attitude, long-endurance drone that can also be armed with missiles. Its third generation, an intercontinental drone that can fly 10,000km, made its debut at the Zhuhai show this year.\n\nThe reported order at the Zhuhai Air Show also included a production line of TB001 UAVs, also a medium-altitude, long-endurance combat drone that the PLA started to use on patrols near Taiwan this year; YJ-21 anti-ship ballistic missiles, a carrier-based hypersonic missile with combat range of over 2,000km (1,200 miles); and the \u201cSilent Hunter\u201d anti-drone laser-based systems.\n\nBesides sales on the public record, China reportedly secretly sold DF-21 missiles to Riyadh in 2007, with the CIA\u2019s approval after finding the missiles were not nuclear-capable. Some observers say that compared with the DF-3, the DF-21 is much more accurate and is sometimes called a \u201ccarrier killer\u201d.\n\n\nIn May 2023, Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) was in talks with China North Industries Group Corporation (Norinco), a state-owned defence company, to buy weapons ranging from reconnaissance drones to air defence systems, according to Tactical Report, a Beirut-based intelligence service focused on the Middle East.",
