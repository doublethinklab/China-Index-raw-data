        "Despite a few years of lukewarm relations between Tanzania and China, especially during the presidency of John Magufuli, Tanzania's new administration seems to have rekindled the relations with PRC. President Samia Suluhu Hassan signed deals with President Xi Jinping in September 2022 when she visited Beijing.",

There is therefore a need to study the role of the party school in China's party-to-party diplomacy.",
        "There has been increased military cooperation between China and Tanzania especially after the opening of the Chinese built Comprehensive Training Centre (CTC). In 2022 and 2023, there were joint naval training exercises off the Indian Ocean coast as the two countries extended their long-standing defence and military training partnership to the naval domain."
