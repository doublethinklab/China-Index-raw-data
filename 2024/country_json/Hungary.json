        "The results support the impression that there is relatively little effort by the PRC to directly influence Hungarian society. Most Chinese influence works through the Hungarian government, which maintains very close links to the PRC, and is willing to relay, to some extent, Chinese influence towards Hungary\u2019s economy and society.",
        "The results show that the nature of Chinese influence in Hungary is primarily economic and technological, which is explained by the importance that the Hungarian government attaches to playing a \u201cbridging role\u201d between East and West, and to getting access to Chinese investment and technology.",
        "The results identify Hungary as one of the main outliers within the European Union in terms of its foreign policy preferences regarding China. Although the Hungarian government does not voice its support for China on controversial domestic or international issues (with the exception of the Ukrainian peace plan), it generally treats relations with China as a value-free domain where human rights are secondary to economic interests. It also tries to distance itself from the policies and interests of the United States and other European powers with global security interests, and is often more aligned with Germany on foreign policy issues with possible impact on economic relations with China."
