The offer varies considerably depending on the federal state. In North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin, Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg most schools offer Chinese as a subject, in other federal states Chinese is only offered as a study group. In twelve federal states where Chinese is taught in high school, it can also be chosen as a high school diploma subject, usually as an oral examination subject. About 5,000 German school-age children are learning Chinese but the number is decreasing. There is awareness of the difficulties around this issue and the China strategy drafted by the German government in July 2023 dedicates a whole chapter on the question of improving China competency. It is unknown, however, whether the PRC provides educational books from China.",
