        "Bolivia is highly exposed to PRC influence. On the one hand, in the domains of Media, Academia and Society, it is clear that little effort is needed by the PRC to gain leverage, while on the economic side, Bolivia sees in the PRC a great ally, especially when it comes to debts swaps and trade. This has foreign policy repercussions, with former president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, being a vocal support of the PRC.",
        "The Law Enforcement and Military Domains are the less exposed to the PRC. This could be because of the close historical relationship of the Bolivian military and law enforcement with the US, and in particular Drug Enforcement Administration.",
        "Over the last few years, Bolivia has experienced an internal political crisis that made it more difficult for the PRC and the Bolivian government to keep a fluid relationship. However, trips and exchanges have continued, as captured by Indicators in the Media, Academia and Domestic Politics Domains."
