Only 13-17% of Afghanistan's total exports went to China between 2015 and 2020, with agricultural products being the main export to China. Although there is some evidence of Chinese involvement in extractive projects in Afghanistan, it is extremely unclear to what extent these projects are active and how raw materials are being exported.
