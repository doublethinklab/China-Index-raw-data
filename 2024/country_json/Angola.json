        "In 2023, Angola and the PRC marked 40 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations. This resulted in an increase in activities and exchanges, particularly at the political level. The celebration has also been reflected in the growth of pro-PRC narratives across sectors of Angolan society, from the media, to academia, and beyond.",
