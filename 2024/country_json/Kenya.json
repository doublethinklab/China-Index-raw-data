        "The PRC's biggest influence in Kenya can be seen in the Media and Economy Domains. The media plays a vital part in PRC influence efforts, owing to the Chinese media prescence in Kenya, which in turn has resulted in state media content published in Swahili, content agreements with PRC state media, and PRC stakeholdings in the distribution of digital TV signals.",
        "Kenyan politicians from the past and current regime have shown an eagerness to learn from CCP longevity, which illustrates the influence that China has on Kenya's politics. This includes regular visits by CCP officials to Kenya to train political parties and meet with party members and parliamentarians.",
        "In the Domestic Politics Pomain, legislation preventing local governments from engaging directly with foreign countries and signing deals has reduced local level engagement with the PRC which only happens at a government to government level.",
        "Compared to other Domains, Law Enforcement is the least influenced. The evidence of influence in the Domain is systematic, consisting of trainings offered to police officers in Kenya and the use of Chinese sourced surveillance equipment.",
        "China has shown intent to increase its military cooperation with Kenya. China has donated military equipment such as vehicles to the Kenya Defence Forces, and Kenya's military has introduced Chinese language lessons for military personnel. These Indicators, coupled with claims of interest in setting up a base in the country, warrant closer analysis of influence in this Domain."
