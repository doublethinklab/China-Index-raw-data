        "South Africa is increasingly tied to China economically, with China being its largest trading partner and a significant investor in critical sectors such as energy. South Africa has also joined China-led multilateral institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and engages with China through the BRICS bloc.",
        "South Africa's ruling party at the time of data collection, the African National Congress (ANC), has significant ties to the Chinese Communist Party, including receiving political training.",
        "South African media is fairly resilient to Chinese influence in terms of changing content to please China, with the exception of Independent Media Group. The sector is financially vulnerable, but organisationally strong.",
        "Chinese technology companies, particularly Huawei, have made substantial inroads into South Africa's telecommunications and surveillance infrastructure. Huawei is involved in providing 4G\/5G networks, fibre optic cables, and 'smart city' systems to South African entities, potentially raising concerns about data security, privacy and surveillance.",
        "While South Africa remains largely silent on controversial issues related to China's domestic policies (Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan), it has shown growing alignment with China's foreign policy positions and initiatives. This is evident in South Africa's participation in joint military exercises with China and Russia, and its membership in China's space program to establish a lunar base. But the local arms and security industries act to provide some protection."

Under Jacob Zuma's presidency, the Dalai Lama was denied a visa three times in five years, drawing widespread criticism. Furthermore, the Chinese Embassy's strong condemnation of the 2018 visit by the head of the Tibetan government-in-exile, claiming it was met with \"furious opposition and rejection from the South African government,\" suggests South Africa's silent agreement with China's position on Tibet (1, 2). In fact, in 2021 the Dalai Lama did not apply for a visa to attend his friend and co-author, Bishop Desmond Tutu's funeral (3). Although no official pronouncement has been made explicitly supporting China's treatment of Tibet, South Africa's actions in recent years indicate a quiet acquiescence to China's stance.",
