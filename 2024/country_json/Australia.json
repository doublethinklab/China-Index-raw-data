        "As with 2022, Australia continues to score the highest in its Economy Domain. This is due to Australia's proximity with China, the PRC's deep involvement in Australian infrastructure, and the continued use of economic coercion by China in its engagement with Australia.",
        "Foreign Policy replaced Military as the lowest-scoring category in 2023. This is partly due to changes in individual indicators and the fact that cases previously observed in Foreign Policy indicators have fallen outside the accepted evidence date range with no replacements. The latter suggest a hardening of foreign policy towards China in recent years.",
        "The PRC has attempted to build its political influence in Australia on different levels. It has attempted to court politicians on both the federal level and the state level, signing agreements to secure their support. It has also cultivated friendly voices in Australian politics among Australia's junior cohort of politicians and its more experienced statespeople.",
        "In seeking to build political influence, the PRC has given special attention to the Chinese Australian community, given its relative size and decisive role in several parliamentary constituencies in Australia. The PRC has done so by grooming politicians in predominantly Chinese communities in Australia, as well as targeting the Chinese diaspora with various cultural activities and propaganda."

While such remarks exist almost exclusively in Chinese media and may not represent the views of Chinese Australians, the ACPPRC engages with Members of Parliament in private and its members regularly attend fundraising events, seeking to engage with political campaigns.
