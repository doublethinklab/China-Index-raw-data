        "The results indicate that academia remains a key component of PRC influence in North Macedonia. North Macedonia\u2019s higher education institutions largely cooperate with their counterparts from China through bilateral projects, and the number of these projects in some areas surpasses that with Western countries. This is also in sharp contrast to other economic and political parameters in which China is far less present.",
        "Another key component of Chinese strategic messaging in North Macedonia is through Chinese culture. This allows China to paint an idealized picture of itself as a culturally rich, successful and benevolent entity among citizens who are otherwise less informed about Chinese current events and life.",
        "The penetration of China in the Technology and Economy Domains has been practically stalled in recent years. In 2023, there was a noticeable lack of new key agreements for supply of sensitive equipment and technologies owing to the fact that North Macedonia has enforced the bulk of Western restrictions."

The Ministry of Education undertakes cooperation on the basis of the Agreement on Cooperation in the field of education, signed on December 5, 2007, in Beijing. The Scientific and technological cooperation agreement between the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, was signed on March 7 1995 in Skopje. According to North Macedonia\u2019s Education Ministry there are currently over 20 scientific cooperation projects, concluded or active. Among them is the cooperation project between Skopje\u2019s Institute for Earthquake Engineering and the Dalian University of Technology in 2018 and 2019. Another example is the cooperation between  Skopje\u2019s state Faculty of Electronic Technical and Information Sciences, FEIT, with the School of Electronics and IT at the Xian Zhu university. Together they have worked on early diagnostics and error prevention for the Chinese rapid railroad system. Huawei\u2019s Seeds for the Future project has been sending North Macedonia students on study visits in China which is evident by the yearly calls for scholarships which amount to around ten each year.",

A research report dubbed \"Understanding the tools, narratives and influence of Chinese 'soft power' in North Macedonia\" by the author Ana Krstinovska, which was published by ESTIMA and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation near the end of 2022, points out that probably the most important long-term tool for strengthening Chinese soft power in North Macedonia is the opening of this institute. This has resulted in gradual but constant increase of studentrs who learn or have learned the Chinese language and culture which currenlty accounts for several hundred people. Therefore, this indicator deserves a \"Significant\" rating.",

                "evidence": "While the use of hardware from these companies was relatively common before 2020, that year North Macedonia signed a memorandum for safe 5G network with the United States that practically prohibited these purchases. This prevented Makedonski Telekom, owned ultimately by Deutsche Telecom, from purchasing equipment from Huawei for its 5G network. Thus, while in the past telecoms have signed such agreements for 3G and 4G equipment, they are now prohibited from doing so as 5G is about to be rolled out. Consequently, in 2022 Makedonski Telekom launched its 5G network but the equipment was purchased from Ericsson. It was the same case with the second telecom provider, A1, which is owned by Austrian Telecom, which also purchased its equipment from Ericsson.\nHowever, the extent of the use of previously purchased Chinese 3G and 4G equipment by telecom operators is not fully clear. The regulatory body, the Agency for Electronic Communications, AEK, in 2022 and in 2023 said that the intent is for this equipment to be gradually phased out by the operators by the end of 2023. The operators however are reluctant to speak in detail about the pace of this process and whether it has been completed. So in essence there is circumstantial evidence that operators no longer purchase 4G equipment from Chinese producers and are phasing out the old equipment, but there is no way to verify that for sure.
