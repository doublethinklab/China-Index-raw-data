These agreements are generally not public, and most information about them has been discovered through interviews with journalists. Other Taiwanese media republish or post Chinese state media content without an agreement; for example, China Times rebroadcasts the press conferences of China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office on its Facebook and YouTube pages. Some outlets that do not want to publish negative reports about China instead wait for CCTV to publish a story and then adhere to that narrative.\nDuring the PRC military drills in April 2023, multiple Taiwanese media were coerced by the Taiwan Affairs Office to use the content provided by People's Liberation Army rather than the Taiwanese military. \nOther than the news outlets, there are laws regulating the approval of Chinese films and TV shows broadcasting in Taiwan. However, the Taiwanese TV stations have imported many Chinese shows to reduce their production cost. According to the open data of Bureau of Audiovisual and Music Industry Development, Ministry of Culture, there have been 681 cases of Chinese TV shows being approved to broadcast in 2022. People can easily gain access to Chinese TV stations with set-top boxes, such as Xiaomi Boxes, and from internet platforms and social media, without the shows being approved by the Taiwanese government. Chinese government also release shows with united front purposes targeting Taiwanese audience (including the Taiwanese-speaking public).",

It was fined as it was never submitted for approval. Although there is stronger regulation on the advertisement from China, especially the government-related ones, it is challenging to regulate the embedded advertising in news coverage by laws. In 2010, Frank Wu, the member of Control Yuan (the investigatory and auditory institute of Taiwanese government), raised a corrective measures against Mainland Affairs Council. In the report, it mentioned that 2 major Taiwanese newspapers United News and China Times has embedded advertisement about multiple Chinese provinces in their news articles, and has contracts with the provincial governments for the deals. (He Qinglian, 2016, Red Infiltration: the Truth About the Global Expansion of Chinese Media, p168) In a 2012 news article, it revealed that Want Want China Times Group cooperated with the governments of Fujian Province and Xiamen City to purchase news coverage and had a concrete plan on propaganda. And in August 2019, an investigation report of Reuters revealed with proof that, China has brought at least 5 Taiwanese media, and use them to push forward their propaganda to the Taiwanese audience. From the documents that the journalist have reviewed, most of the contracts are from the Taiwan Affairs Office. But there are also a few contracts from other government sectors, such as the government of a southern province. There is also frequent exposure of the advertisement of Chinese state media on social media. Since those websites\/applications are banned in China, it's clear that the ads are targeted at foreign viewers. There hasn't been much evidence on the situation as the PRC government still attempts to influence the 2024 elections in Taiwan.",
