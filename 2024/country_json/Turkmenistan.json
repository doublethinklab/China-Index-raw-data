Given that Turkmenistan has some of the worst-ranked media freedoms in the world, the few state-owned media outlets are authoritative, as the Turkmen public has no access to alternative sources. Since all Turkmen media are state-controlled and have cooperation with the PRC, this can be interpreted as a state-approved decision to work more closely with the PRC in media cooperation. This reflects Chinese influence on Turkmenistan's foreign priorities in the sense that the Turkmen state wants its public to know that the government is working with the PRC. This is significant in terms of the state's messaging, rather than the PRC actually influencing Turkmen media content.",

While few training programs are exclusively directed at Turkmenistan, we rated this case a 4 due to the dictatorial nature of the Turkmen government and the role of the PRC in potentially strengthening it.\n\nHowever, it has been observed that few officials in Ashgabat seemed to be aware of these trainings that took place in China, casting doubt on their effectiveness in influencing governance. Despite this, we maintain the rating of 4 because Turkmens have limited choices for foreign training, restricted mainly to Russia and Turkey. The fact that Turkmenistan is grouped with other Central Asian states also reflects the PRC's preference for fostering Central Asian regionalism.",
