        "Since President Marcos took office, Philippine policies became palpably less pro-China and more critical and cynical about its geopolitical motivations. Among others, Marcos himself initiated a review of previous China loans and has stood up to Chinese aggression in the West Philippine Sea. He did leave alone some Duterte-era approaches, adopting a One China policy and not budging on the Uyghur situation in Xinjiang.",
