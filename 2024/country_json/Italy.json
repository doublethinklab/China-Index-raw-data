        "As a large, longstanding member of the EU, Italy has been permanently exposed to courting and\/or pressure from Beijing. Mass media is one sector where the influence is felt: free content provided by PRC found its way onto some channels, while in other cases journalists were banned from events. In Academia, there are high profile cases of individuals, some also with political connections, who provide institutional support for the PRC.",
        "Law Enforcement remains a vulnerable area, as the extradition treaty with PRC is still in force. Chinese groups of organized crime are active, including members of the Triads, especially in the Prato and Rome regions. Shadow PRC police stations may function in Italy to monitor and coerce members of the diaspora, though the embassy says these are support operations staffed with volunteers.",
        "PRC-related companies continue to be active in critical infrastructure, for instance in sea ports and telecoms, but their expansion has stopped and influence is likely to diminish as a results of measures taken at the EU level.",
        "Italy left the Belt and Road Initative in 2023; before that, it was the only G7 country taking part in the Initiative. There has been a visible cooling of bilateral relations between Rome and Beijing lately, and signs of rapprochement with Taiwan."
