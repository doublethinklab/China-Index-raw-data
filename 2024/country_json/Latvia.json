        "Latvia shows no observable instances of People's Republic of China (PRC) influence in media-related areas. The country has a parliamentary friendship group with the PRC and received limited foreign aid from a Chinese company. However, it lacks significant involvement in diplomatic relationships, territorial claims, treatment of Uyghurs, Tibet, or the situation in Hong Kong.",
        "Latvia experiences limited academic interactions with PRC-connected entities, including research partnerships and Confucius Institutes. However, there is an overall absence of observable influence in academia-related indicators, such as curriculum design, talent recruitment programs, scholars' travels, and pressures on critical opinions or publications aligning with PRC talking points.",
        "In domestic politics, Latvia exhibits minimal observable influence from the PRC, with no reported signed agreements, significant donations, or other Indicators. Sister-city ties and occasional visits to the PRC exist, but overall, direct PRC influence remains insignificant in shaping political decisions in Latvia.",
        "Latvia's economic ties with the PRC are limited, with no significant trade partnerships, ownership of sovereign debt, or critical infrastructure control observed. In the technology landscape, Latvia shows limited involvement with PRC-connected entities, excluding Chinese companies from its 5G infrastructure and exhibiting minimal engagement in critical technology areas",
        "There is no prominent presence of local groups propagating views on Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang in Latvia. Limited affiliation with the United World Chinese Association, minimal interaction between labor unions and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the absence of notable events sponsored by PRC entities indicate a restrained impact on societal aspects. Latvia also demonstrates minimal observable indicators of significant military engagement with the PRC and no significant law enforcement indicators related to China."

Native Russian speakers (36% of Latvia\u2019s population) are more open to Chinese narratives. In a 2020 survey,  two-thirds of the Russian-speaking respondents thought well of China. That is 30 percentage points higher than the share of Latvian-speakers who took a positive view of China (32%). Almost 30% of all respondents thought China is culturally attractive and 30% agreed that China is important for the economic development of Latvia. Only 9% of respondents, however, thought that the human rights situation in China was positive, and less than 7% trusted China. In the GLOBSEC Trends 2021  survey, carried out in March 2021, 17% of  respondents believed that the Chinese political regime could be an inspiration for Latvia.\nhttps:\/\/cepa.org\/comprehensive-reports\/chinese-influence-in-latvia\/ \n55% of respondents in Latvia are neutral towards China (2022) - https:\/\/bnn-news.com\/55-of-respondents-in-latvia-are-neutral-towards-china-study-finds-241491\n\u201cLatvian respondents overall demonstrate neutral and even positive attitudes towards China, with almost 42.3% viewing China in a very positive or positive light, and 30% having a neutral attitude (Figure 1). Interestingly, China is overall viewed more positively than the USA (Figure 3). Only 28% of the respondents have a negative or a very negative view of China, which is significantly lower than the survey-wide average across 13 countries \u2013 45.3%.\u201d  https:\/\/ceias.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/LV-poll-report.pdf \n\n\nIn September and October 2020, the Sinophone Borderlands project at Palack\u00fd University Olomouc conducted a wide-scale survey of public opinion on China in 13 European countries. https:\/\/ceias.eu\/survey-europeans-views-of-china-in-the-age-of-covid-19\/ \n\n\u201cThere is still a belief among Latvian society that Chinese wealth could spill over into the Latvian economy via transit, export and investment. When indicating preferred Latvian foreign policy priorities towards China, 81.1% respondents believe policy should be focused on \u201cpromotion of trade and investment\u201d, and 62.1% of respondents share some degree of agreement over China\u2019s capability to help the national transit sector.\u201d \nhttps:\/\/www.fpri.org\/article\/2021\/04\/go-with-the-devil-you-dont-know-latvians-still-believe-in-economic-cooperation-with-china\/ \n\nFurthermore, another survey from 2021 suggests that there are more negative perceptions of China\u2019s actions such as Chinese military power, China\u2019s influence on democracy in other countries, China\u2019s impact on the global environment, while the same survey, more neutral to a rather positive outlook, was allocated to trade with China, Chinese investment and the Belt and Road initiative. As long as economic ties are involved, China is perceived as a friend, while other issues that could in some ways hurt the Western world or its values are perceived in a more negative light. \n\nhttps:\/\/dspace.rsu.lv\/jspui\/bitstream\/123456789\/9855\/1\/China%20in%20the%20Baltic%20states_final_32-54.pdf \n\nhttps:\/\/bnn-news.com\/55-of-respondents-in-latvia-are-neutral-towards-china-study-finds-241491 \n\n",

In turn this economic sway through the CCEEC and SREB frameworks gives China more political leverage over Baltic policies. The Baltic States refers primarily to the three ex-Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia; with Latvia having particularly embraced China\u2019s Silk Road, but also having accommodated the most to Chinese political pressures.\u201d  https:\/\/sciendo.com\/pdf\/10.2478\/jobs-2018-0001 \n\u201cChinese Defense Minister Liang Guanglie here on Monday met his Latvian counterpart Artis Pabriks, with both sides pledging to enhance bilateral military cooperation.\nDuring the meeting, Liang said that China attaches great importance to developing defense and military ties with Latvia and is willing to enhance mutual understanding, strengthen mutual trust, deepen friendship, and promote cooperation so as to push the bilateral military ties to a new level.
